[]{#hunger}**56. Chapter: On the excellence of hunger, a simple live
style, and confining oneself to little in food, drink, clothing and
other things which are the portion of the self, and abandoning
appetites**

grant him peace, never had their fill of barley bread for two
consecutive days until he died.\" \[Agreed upon\]

used to see three crescent moons in two months without a fire being lit
in the houses of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace.\" I said. \"Aunt, what did you live off?\" She said, \"The
two black ones: dates and water. However, the Messenger of Allah had
some neighbours among the Ansar, and they have milk camels, and they
would send us some of their milk and we would drink it.\" \[Agreed
upon\]

493\. Abu Sa\'id al-Maqburi said that Abu Hurayra passed by some people
who had a roast sheep in front of them and they invited him to eat, but
he refused to eat, saying, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, left this world without having his fill of barley
bread.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

494\. Anas said, \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
did not eat off a table up until the time he died, and he did not eat
fine bread up until the time he died.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

In one variant of his, \"He never ever saw a whole roast sheep.\"

495\. An-Nu\'man ibn Bashir said, \"I saw your Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and he did not have enough poor quality dates
to fill his belly.\" \[Muslim\]

496\. Sahl ibn Sa\'d said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, did not see fine bread from the time that Allah
Almighty sent him until the time He took him.\" He was asked, \"Did you
not have sieves in the time of the Messenger of Allah?\" He replied,
\"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, never
saw a sieve from the time that Allah Almighty sent him until the time He
took him.\" He was asked, \"How did you eat unsieved barley?\" He said,
\"We used to rind it and blow on it and what blew away would blow away
and we would knead what remained.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

497\. Abu Hurayra said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went out one day or night and came upon Abu Bakr
and \'Umar and said, \'What has brought you out of your houses at this
hour?\' They said, \'Hunger, Messenger of Allah.\' He said, \'Me too. By
the One in whose hand my soul is, what brought you out brought me out,
so get up.\' They got up with him and went to visit a man of the Ansar,
but he was not at home. When his wife saw him, she said, \'Welcome!
Welcome!\' The Messenger of Allah said to her, \'Where is so-and-so?\'
She said, \'He has gone to get water for us.\' Then the Ansari came and
saw the Messenger of Allah and his two companions and said, \'Praise be
to Allah. Today no one has more honoured guests than I!\' He went and
brought them a branch with unripe and ripe fresh dates on it and said,
\'Eat.\' He took a knife and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said to him, \'Don\'t slaughter one which yields
milk.\' So he slaughtered for them and they ate from the sheep and from
that branch and drank. When they were full and their thirst quenched,
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to
Abu Bakr and \'Umar, \'By the One who has my soul in His hand, you will
be asked about this blessing on the Day of Rising. Hunger brought you
out of your houses and you did not return until you had received this
blessing.\'\" \[Muslim\]

The Ansari who they visited was Abu\'l-Haytham ibn at-Tayyihan. This is
clearly stated in the variant of at-Tirmidhi and others.

498\. Khalid ibn \'Umayr al-\'Adawi said, \"\'Utba ibn Ghazwan addressed
us when he was governor of Basra. He praised and glorified Allah and
then said, \'This world has announced that it is vanishing, retreating
swiftly and only a trace of it will be left like the small amount left
in a vessel after its owner has drunk it. You are moving from it to an
abode which will not vanish. So move to it with the best you have. It
has been mentioned to us that a stone thrown from the brink of Hellfire
will fall in it for forty years without reaching its bottom. By Allah,
it will be filled! Does that surprise you? It has been mentioned to us
that between the two halves of the Garden is the distance of forty
years, but a day will come when it will be blocked by the crowd of
people there. I remember myself as one of seven who were with the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the
only food we had was some leaves of a tree which cut the corners of our
mouths. I got a cloak and divided it between myself and Sa\'d ibn Malik.
I used half of it as a wrapper and Sa\'d used half as a wrapper. Today
there is not one of us who is not an amir over some city. I seek refuge
with Allah from being great with myself and small with Allah.\"
\[Muslim\]

499\. Abu Musa al-Ash\'ari said, \"\'A\'isha brought out for us a
garment and thick wrapper and said, \'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, died wearing these two.\'\" \[Agreed
upon\]

500\. Sa\'d ibn Abi Waqqas said, \"I was the first of the Arabs to shoot
an arrow in the way of Allah. We used to raid with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we had no food
except acacia leaves so that when one of us went to relieve himself it
was like sheep droppings.\" \[Agreed upon\]

501\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"O Allah, make the provision of the
family of Muhammad adequate!\" \[Agreed upon\]

502\. Abu Hurayra said, \"By Allah, there is no god but He. I used to
lie with my stomach on the ground out of hunger and I used to tie a
stone on my belly because of hunger. One day I sat on the path by which
they used to go out and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, passed by me. He smiled when he saw me and recognised what was in
my face and in myself. Then he said, \'Abu Hirr!\' I said, \'At your
service, Messenger of Allah!\' He said, \'Come along\' and went and
followed him. He went inside and I asked permission to enter. He gave me
permission and I went inside. He found some milk in a cup and asked,
\'Where is this milk from?\' They said, \'So-and-so gave it to you.\' He
said, \'Abu Hirr.\' I said, \'At your service, Messenger of Allah.\' He
said, \'Go along to the people of the Suffa and invite them here to
me.\'\" He said, \"The people of the Suffa were the guests of Islam.
They did not have recourse to family, property or anyone. When sadaqa
came to him, he used to send it to them and not take any of it himself.
When a gift came to him, he sent for them and had some of it himself and
let them share in it. His saying that annoyed me and I said to myself,
\'What good will this milk be among the people of the Suffa? I have more
need of drinking it to give me strength. When they come, he will tell me
to give it to them.\' It was not likely that I would get any of the
milk, but there was no escape from obeying Allah and obeying His
Messenger so I went and invited them and they accepted and asked for
permission to come in and he gave them permission. They took their seats
in the house. He said, \'Abu Hirr!\' I said, \'At your service,
Messenger of Allah.\' He said, \'Take it and give it to them.\'\" He
said, \"I took the cup and gave it to a man and he drank until his
thirst was quenched. Then he returned the cup to me and I gave it to
another man who drank until his thirst was quenched and he returned the
cup to me. \[Another\] drank until his thirst was quenched and he
returned the cup to me until I reached the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, when all the people had had enough. He took the cup
and placed it in his hand and looked at me and smiled. He said, \'Abu
Hirr.\' I said, \'At your service, Messenger of Allah\' He said, \'I and
you remain.\' I said, \'You have spoken the truth, Messenger of Allah.\'
He said, \'Sit and drink.\' I sat and drank. He said, \'Drink.\' So I
drank. He kept saying, \'Drink\' until I said, \'By the One who sent you
with the truth, I cannot find any more room for it.\' He said, \'Give it
to me,\' so I gave him the cup and he praised Allah Almighty, said the
name of Allah, and drank the rest.\". \[al-Bukhari\]

503\. Muhammad ibn Sirin reported that Abu Hurayra said, \"I used to
fall down in a faint between the minbar of the Messenger of Allah , may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the room of \'A\'isha. A
passer-by would come and put his foot on my neck and think that I was
mad. I was not mad. I was only hungry.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

504\. \'A\'isha said, \"When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, died his armour was in pawn to a Jew for thirty
sa\'s of barley.\" \[Agreed upon\]

505\. Anas said, \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
pawned his armour for some barley. I took some barley bread and
dissolved fat to the Prophet and I heard him say, \'The family of
Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has never had more
than a sa\' in the morning nor the evening,\' and they were nine
households.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

506\. Abu Hurayra said, \"I saw seventy of the people of the Suffa and
none of them was wearing a cloak, but only either a waist-wrapper or a
shirt which they tied round their necks so that it only reached half way
down their thighs or to their ankles. They would gather it together with
their hands not wanting their nakedness to be seen.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

507\. \'A\'isha said, \"The bed of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, as made of hide stuffed with
palm-fibre.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

508\. Ibn \'Umar said, \"We were sitting with the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a man of the Ansar came
and greeted him. Then the Ansari turned away and the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \'O brother of the Ansar,
how is Sa\'d ibn \'Ubada!\' He said, \'Well.\' The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \'Who among you wants to
visit him?\' He got up and about ten of us got up with him without
sandals or leather socks or head coverings or shirts. We walked through
those salt marshes until we reached him. His family moved back from
around him so that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and His Companions who were with him could get near.\"
\[Muslim\]\]

509\. \'Imran ibn al-Husayn reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"The best of you are my generation and
then those who follow them and then those who follow them.\" \'Imran
said, \"I do not know whether the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said it twice or three times.\" \"Then after them will come a
people who testify when they are not asked to testify, and who betray
and are not trustworthy, who make a vow and do not fulfil it. Fleshiness
will appear among them.\" \[Agreed upon\]

510\. Abu Umama reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"O son of Adam, it is better for you to
spend what is in excess of your needs and worse for you to keep it. You
will not be blamed for (keeping) enough to cover your needs. Begin with
your immediate dependants.\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

511\. \'Ubaydullah ibn Muhsan al-Ansari al-Khatmi said, \"The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \'Any of you
who wakes up in the morning safe in himself, healthy in his body, with
food for the day, it is as if he had the entire world.\'\"
\[at-Tirmidhi\]

512\. \'Abdullah ibn \'Amr ibn al-\'As reported that the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"The successful
one is he who becomes Muslim, has adequate provision and whom Allah
makes satisfied with what He gives him.\" \[Muslim\]

513\. Abu Muhammad Fadala ibn \'Ubayd al-Ansari reported that he heard
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say,
\"O the delight of the one who is guided to Islam, has adequate
livelihood, and is contented.\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

514\. Ibn \'Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, used to go hungry for nights in a row at the time
when his people could find no support. Most of their bread was barley
bread.\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

515\. Fadala ibn \'Ubayd reported that when the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to lead the people in prayer,
some men who were there would fall over during the prayer owing to
extreme hunger. They were the People of the Suffa. This reached such a
point that the desert Arabs said, \'Those people are mad.\' When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had prayed,
he went to them and said, \'If you only knew what you have with Allah
Almighty, you would wish to be increased in poverty and need.\'\"
\[at-Tirmidhi\]

516\. Abu Karima al-Miqdam ibn Ma\'dikarib said, \"I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \'A human being
fills up no vessel worse than his belly. Enough for a son of Adam are
some morsels which will kept his back straight. If it cannot be avoided,
then a third is for his food, a third for his drink, and a third for
himself.\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

517\. Abu Umama Iyas ibn Tha\'laba al-Ansari al-Harithi said, \"One day
the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, mentioned this world, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, \'Do you not hear? Do you not hear?
Raggedness is part of belief. Raggedness is part of belief,\' meaning
doing without luxury.\" \[Abu Dawud\]

518\. Abu \'Abdullah Jabir ibn \'Abdullah said, \"The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent us on an expedition
and he put Abu \'Ubadya in command over us. We were to meet the caravan
of Quraysh and we were provisioned with bags of dates which we was all
that we could find. Abu \'Ubadya would give each of us a date. It was
asked, \'What did you do with it?\' He said, \'We would suck on it as a
child sucks and then we would drink from water poured on it. It was
enough for us for the day until night. We used to knock leaves off
branches and then moisten them with water and eat them.\'\"

He said, \"We proceeded along the coast and something on the sea coast
looking like an immense heap became visible to us. We reached it and it
was the creature called the sperm whale. Abu \'Ubayda said, \'Carrion.\'
Then he said, \'No, rather we are the messengers of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we are travelling in
the way of Allah and have been forced by need, so eat.\'. We lived on it
for a month - and there were three hundred of us - eating until we were
full. I remember us scooping out oil from its eye-socket with jugs, and
from it we cut saddle-cloths the size of an ox - or similar to the size
of an ox. Abu \'Ubayda took thirteen of us and had us sit in its
eye-socket, and he took one of its ribs and stood it upright and then
the largest camel we had with us went under it. We took provision from
its meat and strips of dried meat. When we reached Madina, we went to
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and
mentioned that to him. He said, \'It was provision with which Allah
provided you. Do you have any of its meat with you so that you can feed
us?\' So we sent some of it to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and he ate it.\" \[Muslim\]

519\. Asma\' bint Yazid said, \"The sleeve of the shirt of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, reached his wrist.\"
\[at-Tirmidhi\]

520\. Jabir said, \"On the Day of the Ditch, we were digging and a hard
bit of rock became exposed. They went to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and said, \"\'There is a hard bit of rock
exposed in the Ditch.\' He said, \'I am coming down.\' He got up and
there was a stone tied to his belly. We had been three days without
eating at all. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
took a pick and struck it and it became like soft sand. I said,
\'Messenger of Allah, give me permission to go to my house.\' I said to
my wife, \'I see that the Prophet is in a condition I cannot bear. Do
you have anything?\' She said, \'I have some barley and a lamb.\' So I
sacrificed the lamb and she ground the barley and we put the meat in a
cooking-pot. Then I went to the Messenger of Allah when the bread was
kneaded and the pot was on the cooking stones and nearly cooked and
said, \'I have a little food, so, Messenger of Allah, come with one or
two men.\' He asked, \'How much is it?\' I told him and he said, \'Many
is good. Tell her not to remove the pot nor take the bread from the oven
until I come.\' He said, \'Get up,\' and the Muhajirun and Ansar got up.
I went to her and said, \'Poor you! The Prophet, the Muhajirun, the
Ansar and those with them have all come!\' She said, \'Did he ask you?\'
I said. \'Yes.\' He said, \'Enter, but do not crowd round.\' He began to
break up the bread and put meat on it, covering the pot and oven after
he took something from them. He gave it to his Companions who then
withdrew. He continued to breaking up bread and ladling until they were
full and there was still some left. He said, \'Eat this and give some
away, for hunger has afflicted the people.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

In one variant, Jabir said, \"When the ditch was dug, I saw that the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was hungry, so I went
back to my wife and said, \'Do you have anything? I see that the
Messenger of Allah is very hungry.\' She brought out a bag which
contained a sa\' of barley. We had a lamb we had kept at home, so I
slaughtered it and she ground the barley. I finished and cut it up in
her cooking-pot. Then I turned to go back to the Messenger of Allah. She
said, \'Do not disgrace me before the Messenger of Allah and those with
him.\' I went to him and spoke confidentially to him, \'Messenger of
Allah, we have slaughtered a small lamb of ours and ground a sa\' of
barley, so let you and a few people come.\' The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, shouted, \'People of the Ditch!
Jabir has prepared some food, so come along!\' The Prophet said, \'Do
not remove your pot nor bake your bread until I come.\' I came and the
Prophet came leading the people. I went to my wife and she said, \'It is
all your fault!\' I said, \'I did what you said.\' She brought out the
dough and he spat in it and blessed it. Then he went to our pot and spat
and blessed it. Then he said, \'Call the woman who bakes and let her
bake with you, and ladle from your pot and do not remove it.\' There
were a thousand of them. I swear by Allah, they ate until they left the
food and went away. Our pot was boiling as before and out dough was
baking as before.\"

521\. Anas said, \"Abu Talha said to Umm Sulaym, \'I heard the voice of
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it
was weak and I recognised hunger in it. Do you have anything?\' She
said, \'Yes,\' and produced some barley loaves. She took a scarf of hers
and wrapped up the bread in part of it and then she put it under my
garment and tied the other end of it round me. Then she sent me to the
Messenger of Allah and I took it with me. I found the Messenger of Allah
sitting in the mosque with some people. I stood over them and the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, asked,
\'Did Abu Talha send you?\' I answered, \'Yes.\' He said, \'For a
meal?\' I replied, \'Yes.\' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, ordered, \'Get up.\' Then he set off and I went on
ahead of them until I came to Abu Talha and informed him. Abu Talha
said, \'Umm Sulaym! The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, has come with some people, and we do not have anything
to feed them.\' She said, \'Allah and His Messenger know best.\' Abu
Talha went to meet the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and the Messenger of Allah went forward with him until they
both entered and the Messenger of Allah said, \'Bring what you have, Umm
Sulaym.\' So she brought that bread and the Messenger of Allah commanded
it to be broken up and then Umm Sulayman squeezed some ghee on it to
flavour it.\' Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said what Allah willed over it and then he said, \'Admit
ten,\' and he admitted them. They ate until they were full and then went
out. Then he said, \'Admit ten\' and he admitted them. They ate until
they were full and then went out. Then he said, \'Admit ten\' and he
admitted them and so on until all the people had eaten and were full,
and there were seventy or eighty men.\" \[Agreed upon\]

In one variant, \"Ten continued to enter and ten leave until everyone of
them had entered and eaten until he was full up, and then they gathered
it up and there was the same amount as when they had begun to eat from
it.\"

In one variant, \"They ate ten by ten until eighty men had done that.
Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ate after
that and the people of the house, and there was still some left over.\"

In one variant, \"Then they still had enough left over to send to their
neighbours.\"

In one variant Anas said, \"I came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, one day and I found him sitting with his
Companions and he had tied a band around his stomach. I asked some of
his Companions, \'Why has the Messenger of Allah bound up his stomach.\'
They said, \'Out of hunger.\' So I went to Abu Talha, who was the
husband of Umm Sulaym bint Milhan, and said, \'O father, I have seen the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with his
stomach tied with a band and I asked some of his Companions and they
said, \"It is from hunger.\" Abu Talha went in to my mother and asked,
\'Do you have anything?\' She replied, \'Yes, I have some pieces of
barley and some dates. If the Messenger of Allah comes to us alone, we
can give him his fill. If someone else comes with him, it will be little
for them,\'\" and he mentioned the whole hadith.

Truth, I will never again ask anyone for anything until I leave this

out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, on an expedition and six of us were sharing one camel which we
took it in turns to ride. Our feet became pierced through and my feet
were pierced through and my toe-nails came off. We wrapped our feet in
rags and so it became called the Expedition of Rags because of that.\"

glorified Him and then said, \'As for what follows (*amma ba\'d*), by
Allah, I give to one man and leave out another and yet I love the one
whom I leave out more than the one I give to. But I give to some people
because of the anxiety and unease I see in their hearts. I entrust some
people to the wealth and good which Allah has placed in their hearts.

than red camels.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

Messenger of Allah.\' He said, \'Will you not give allegiance to the
Messenger of Allah?\' and we stretched out our hands and said, \'We have
already given you our allegiance, Messenger of Allah. On what basis

obey,\' and he said something softly, \'and that you do not ask people

not ask anyone to hand it to him.\" \[Muslim\]

him.\" \[Muslim\]

557\. Abu Kabsha \'Umar ibn Sa\'d al-Anmari heard the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \"Three things I
can swear to you and I will tell you something you should remember. The
property of a slave is not decreased by sadaqa. There is no slave who is
inflicted by an injustice and is steadfast in it, without Allah
increasing him in might. No slave opens the door of begging without
Allah opening for him the door of poverty.\" - or words to that effect.
\"The something which you should remember,\" he said, \"Is that this
world consists of four types of people. There is a slave whom Allah
provides with money and knowledge and he is fearful of his Lord in
respect of it and maintains ties of kinship with it and acknowledges the
right of Allah over it. This one is in the best position. There is a
slave whom Allah provides with knowledge but does not provide with
money. He has a sincere intention and says, \'If I had money, I would
have acted as so-and-so acted.\' He has according to his intention, so
the reward of both of them is the same. There is a slave whom Allah
provides with money but does not provide with knowledge, so he proceeds
haphazardly with his money without any knowledge. He is not fearful of
his Lord in respect of it nor does he maintain ties of kinship with it
nor acknowledge the right of Allah over it. This person is in the worst
position. There is a slave whom Allah does not provide with either money
nor knowledge, so he says, \'If I had money, I would have acted as
so-and-so acted. He has according to his intention, so the burden of sin
of both of them is the same.\"

560\. Abu Hurayra reported that he heard the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \"The likeness of the miser
and the one who gives is like two men wearing shirts of chain-mail from
their breasts to their collar bones. When the giver of *sadaqa* spends,
his shirt expands over his body until it covers his fingertips and
obliterates his footsteps. When the miser wants to spend anything, every
link remains in its place. He tries to make it looser but it will not
get looser.\" \[Agreed upon\]

561\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"If anyone gives in sadaqa as much as a

the giver, just like one of you might rear a foal, until it is the size
of a mountain.\" \[Agreed upon\]

heard a voice in a cloud saying, \'Water the garden of so-and-so.\' And
that cloud went and poured out its water into a rocky area. There was a
certain water channel which held all the water and he followed it and
found a man standing in his garden directing the water with his spade.
He said to him. \'Slave of Allah, what is your name?\' He said,
\'So-and-so\' giving the same name he had heard from the cloud. The man
then said to him, \'O slave of Allah, why did you ask me my name?\' He
said, \'I heard a voice in the cloud from which this water came say,
\"Water the garden of so-and-so\" giving your name. What are you doing
with it?\' He said, \'Since you have said this, I will \[say\]. I wait
and see what it produces and give a third of it away as *sadaqa*, and my
family and I eat from a third, and I reinvest a third back into it.\"

563\. Jabir reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, \"Beware of injustice. Injustice will be

nothing but water.\' Then he sent to another and she said the same
thing, until they had all said the same thing: \'By the One who sent you
with the truth, I have nothing but water.\' The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \'Who will give hospitality tonight?\' A
man of the Ansar said, \'I will, Messenger of Allah.\' He took him to
his place and said to his wife, \'Honour the guest of the Prophet.\'\"

In one variant, \"He said to his wife, \'Do you have anything?\' She
said, \'No, only the children\'s food.\' He said, \'Divert them with
something else. When they want supper, put them to sleep. When our guest
comes in, put out the lamp and I will look as if I\'m eating.\' So they

waist-wrapper. Someone admired it and said, \'Give it to me to wear. How
beautiful it is!\' He said, \'Yes,\' and the Prophet sat down in the
assembly and then went back and folded it and sent it to him. The people
said, \'You have not acted rightly. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, wore it out of need for it and then you asked him for
it knowing that he never refuses a request.\' He said, \'By Allah, I
have not asked for it in order to wear it, but I have asked for it only
so that it can be my shroud.\'\" Sahl said, \"It was indeed his
shroud.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

568\. Abu Musa reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, \"The Ash\'arites ran short of food on a raid - or

[]{#anger}**77. Chapter: On anger when the sacred things of the Shari\'a
are violated and helping the deen of Allah Almighty**

> Allah says, *\"If someone honours Allah\'s the sacred rites, that is

> *\"If you help Allah, He will help you and make your feet firm.\"*
> (W47:8; H47:7)

649\. Abu Mas\'ud \'Uqba ibn \'Amr al-Badri said, \"A man came to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, \'By Allah,
Messenger of Allah, the only reason I do not attend the morning prayer
is because so-and-so makes the prayer too long for us.\' I have never
seen the Messenger of Allah more angry in giving admonition than he was
that day. He said, \'Some of you make things difficult for people. Any
of you who of you lead people in prayer should make it short. Among you
there are those who are weak, old and have things they must do.\'\"
\[Agreed upon\]

650\. \'A\'isha said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, came from a journey and I had screened off a shelf of
mine with a curtain which had some figures on it. When the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw it, he ripped it
down and his face changed colour. He said, \'\'A\'isha, the people with
the worst punishment with Allah on the Day of Rising will be those who
make things like Allah\'s creation.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

651\. \'A\'isha reported that Quraysh were concerned with the case of a
Makhzumi woman who had stolen something and they said, \"Who will speak
to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
about her?\" They said, \"Who is bold enough to do it except Usama ibn
Zayd, the beloved of the Messenger of Allah?\" Usama spoke to him and
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
\"How can you intercede when it is a case of one of the legal
punishments of Allah Almighty?\" Then he stood up and spoke and said,
\"Those before you were destroyed because when a noble among them stole,
they let him be, but when the weak among them stole, they carried out
the legal punishment on them. By Allah, if Fatima the daughter of
Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.\" \[Agreed upon\]

652\. Anas reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, saw some phlegm in the qibla. It was so offensive to him that it
could be seen in his face. He got up and scraped it off with his hand.
He said, \"When anyone does the prayer, he is speaking to his Lord and
his Lord Allah is between him and the qibla. None of you should spit
towards qibla, but rather to his left or under his food.\" Then he took
the end of his cloak and spat into it and then folded it up and said,
\"Or he should do this.\" \[Agreed upon\]

The command to spit to his left or under his foot refers to outside the
mosque. In the mosque, you should only spit into your garment.

to their subjects, to give them good counsel and to be compassionate to
them, and forbidding those in authority from cheating them, being harsh

> (W26:214; H26:215) and the Almighty says, *\"Allah commands to justice

653\. Ibn \'Umar said, \"I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, say, \'All of you are shepherds. Each of you is
responsible for his flock. An imam is a shepherd and is responsible for
his flock. A man is a shepherd in respect of his family and is
responsible for his flock. The woman is a shepherd in respect of her
husband\'s house and is responsible for her flock. The servant is a
shepherd in respect of his master\'s property and is responsible for his
flock. All of you are shepherds and each of you is responsible for his
flock.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \'No slave is made
shepherd over a flock by Allah and dies and is cheating his flock on the
day he dies without Allah denying him the garden.\" \[Agreed upon\]

In one variant, \"The fragrance of the Garden will not reach him if he
does not give it good counsel.\"

In the variant of Muslim, \"Any amir who is appointed over the affairs
of the Muslim and then does not strive for them and advise them well
will not enter the Garden with them.\"

655\. \'A\'isha said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say in this house of his, \'O Allah, anyone who
is appointed over any of the affairs of my community and is hard on
them, I will be hard on him. Anyone who is appointed over any of the
affairs of my community and is kind to them, I will be kind to him.\"
\[Muslim\]

656\. Abu Hurayra said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, \"The tribe of Israel used to be ruled by the
Prophets. Whenever a Prophet died, another Prophet would succeed him.
There is no Prophet after me, but after me there will be khalifs, and
there will be many of them.\" They said, \"O Messenger of Allah, what do
you command us?\" He said, \"Give full allegiance to the first and then
the next and then give them their rights and ask Allah for that which is
due to you. Allah will question them about that which they were put in
charge of.\" \[Agreed upon\]

657\. \'A\'idh ibn \'Amr reported that he visited \'Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad
and said to him, \"My boy, I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, \'The worst of shepherds is the
harsh one.\' Beware lest you be one of them.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

658\. Abu Maryam al-Azdi told Mu\'awiya, \"I heard the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \"If Allah puts
someone in charge of any of the affairs of the Muslims and he is then
blind to their needs, friendship and poverty, Allah will be blind to his
needs, friendship and poverty on the Day of Rising.\'\" Mu\'awiya,
therefore, put a man in charge of seeing to the needs of the people.

659\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"There are seven whom Allah will shade with His
shade on the day when there is no shade but His shade: a just Imam, a
youth who grows up worshipping Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, a man
whose heart is attached to the mosque, two men who love each other for
the sake of Allah, meeting and parting for that reason alone, a man who
refuses the advances of a noble and beautiful woman, saying, \'I fear
Allah\', a man who gives sadaqa and conceals it so that his left hand
does not know what his right hand gives, and a man who remembers Allah
when he is alone and his eyes overflow with tears.\" \[Agreed upon\]

660\. \'Abdullah ibn \'Amr ibn al-\'As reported, \"The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \'Those who are
just will be on minbars of light with Allah. They are those who are just
in respect of their judgements, their families and what they are put in
charge of.\" \[Muslim\]

661\. \'Awf ibn Malik said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, \'The best of your Imams are those
you love and who love you, whom you pray for and who pray for you. The
worst of your Imams are those you hate and who hate you, and whom you
curse and who curse you.\" He said, \"We said, \'Messenger of Allah,
should we depose them?\' He said, \'No, not as long as they establish
the prayer among you. No, not as long as they establish the prayer among
you.\'\"\[Muslim\]

662\. \'Iyad ibn Himar said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, \'The people of the Garden are
three: a man in power who is just and successful in fulfilling his duty;
a merciful man who is kind-hearted to all his relatives and all the
Muslims; and an abstinent, modest man with a family.\'\" \[Muslim\]

them in an act of rebellion against Allah**

> Messenger, and those in command among you.\"* (W4:58; H4:59)

663\. Ibn \'Umar reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"A Muslim man must hear and obey both in respect
of what he likes and dislikes, unless he is commanded to do a wrong
action. If he is commanded to do a wrong action, he should not hear or
obey.\" \[Agreed upon\]

664\. Ibn \'Umar said, \"When we used to give allegiance to the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to hear and
obey, he would say to us, \'In so far as you are able.\'\" \[Agreed
upon\]

665\. Ibn \'Umar said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, \'Anyone who removes his hand from
obedience will meet Allah on the Day of Rising with no proof. Anyone who
dies without having given the oath of allegiance will die the death of
the Jahiliyya.\'\" \[Muslim\]

In a variant of his, \"Whoever dies split off from the community will
die the death of Jahiliyya.\"

666\. Anas said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, \"Hear and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave with a
head like a raisin is appointed over you.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

667\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"You must hear and obey both in your
hardship and your ease and with regard to what pleases you and what you
dislike and even if you do not get your due.\" \[Muslim\]

668\. \'Abdullah ibn \'Amr said, \"Once we were with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey and we
halted to pitch camp. Some of us were mending wool tents and some of us
were shooting arrows against one another, and some of us were with their
camels. Then the caller of the Messenger of Allah called out, \'The
prayer will be done together.\' So we gathered round the Messenger of
Allah and he said, \'There was no Prophet before me but that it was a
duty for him to direct his community to a good that he knew for them and
to warn them against an evil that he knew for them. The well-being of
this community of mine has been put at its beginning while the last of
it will be afflicted by trials and matters which you dislike. Seditions
will come and each will seem worse than the one before it. A sedition
will come and the believer will say, \"This is my destruction,\" and
then it will depart. And another sedition will come and the believer
will say, \"This is it! This is it!.\" Anyone who wants to be removed
from the Fire and to enter the Garden and to have death come to him
while he believes in Allah and the Last Day should give to other people
what he wants to be given to himself. Whoever gives allegiance to an
Imam, let him give it with the clasp of his hand and the core of his
heart. Let him obey him if he can. If another comes to depose him then
strike the neck of that other.\'\" \[Muslim\]

669\. Abu Hunayda Wa\'il ibn Hujr said, \"Salama ibn Yazid al-Ju\'fi
asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
and said, \'O Prophet of Allah! What is your opinion if amirs are put in
charge of us who ask us for their rights and deny us our rights? What do
you command us to do?\' He turned from him. Then he asked him and the
Messenger of Allah said, \'Hear and obey. They owe what they are charged
with and you owe what you are charged with.\" \[Muslim\]

bless him and grant him peace, said, \'After I am gone there will be
misappropriation and matters of which you disapprove.\' They said, \'O

the rights you owe to others and to ask Allah for what is owed to
you.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

671\. Abu Hurayra said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him

674\. Abu Sa\'id \'Abdu\'r-Rahman ibn Samura said, \"The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, \'O
\'Abdu\'r-Rahman ibn Samura. Do not ask for leadership. If you are given
it without asking for it, you will be helped in it. If you are given it
through asking for it, it will be up to you. If you make a vow and then
see something other than it which is better than it, then do that which
is better and expiate your oath.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

675\. Abu Dharr said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said to me, \'O Abu Dharr! I see that you are weak and
I want for you what I want for myself. You will never be put in charge
of even two men nor be put in charge of the property of an orphan.\'\"
\[Muslim\]

676\. Abu Dharr said, \"I said, \'Messenger of Allah, why do you not
appoint me?\' He clapped me on the shoulder with his hand and then said,
\'Abu Dharr, you are weak. It is a trust, and on the Day of Rising it
will be disgrace and regret except for the man who takes it as it should
be taken and fulfils what is demanded of him in respect of it.\'\"

that Allah protects.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

679\. \'A\'isha said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \'When Allah desires good for the amir, He gives
him a truthful wazir. If he forgets, he reminds him. If he remembers, he
