affect it**

681\. Ibn \'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless

683\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"Belief has over seventy -- or over
sixty -- branches. The best of which is the words, \'There is no god but
Allah,\' and the least of which is removing an obstruction from the
road. Modesty is a branch of belief.\" \[Agreed upon\]

684\. Abu Sa\'id al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, was more modest than a virgin in her
tent. When he saw something he disliked, we could see it in his face.\"

686\. \'Abdullah ibn \'Umar reported that when \'Umar\'s daughter Hafsa
became a widow, \'Umar said, \"I met \'Uthman ibn \'Affan and offered
him Hafsa. I said, \'Would you like to marry Hafsa bint \'Umar?\' He
said, \'I will think about it.\' I waited some days and then he met me
and said, \'I do not think that I should marry at this time. Then I met
Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, \'Would you like to marry Hafsa bint
\'Umar?\' Abu Bakr was silent and did not reply to me at all! I felt
that more than what had happened to me with \'Uthman. I remained some
days and then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
asked to marry her and so I married her to him. Abu Bakr met me and
said, \'Perhaps you were upset at me when you proposed Hafsa to me and I
did not answer you at all?\' I said, \'Yes I was.\' He said, \'All that
prevented me from answering you regarding what you proposed to me was
that I knew that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
had mentioned her and I would not divulge the secret of the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. If the Prophet had
relinquished her, I would have accepted her.\'\" \[al-Bukhari\]

687\. \'A\'isha said, \"The wives of the Prophet were with him when
Fatima arrived on foot. Her gait was exactly like the gait of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he saw
her, he welcomed her and said, \'Welcome, my daughter.\' Then he sat her
down on his right or his left. Then he whispered to her and she wept
bitterly. When he saw her grief, he whispered to her a second time and
she smiled. I said to her, \'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, singled you out before his wives and spoke to you
secretly and then you wept.\' When the Messenger of Allah got up, I
asked her, \'What did the Messenger of Allah say to you?\' She said, \'I
would not disclose the Messenger of Allah\'s secret.\' When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died, I
said, \'I adjure you by the right I have over you, tell me what the
Messenger of Allah said to you.\' She said, \'Now I will. When he
whispered to me the first time, he told me that Jibril had recited the
Qur\'an to him once or twice every year and that now he had made him
recite it twice. (He said), \"I think that my term is near, so be
fearful of Allah and be steadfast. I am the best forerunner for you.\"
So I wept as you saw. When he saw my grief, he whispered to me a second
time and said, \"Fatima, are you not pleased to be the leader of the
women of the believers or the leader of the women of this community?\"
So I smiled as you saw.\'\" \[Agreed upon. This is the variant in
Muslim\]

688\. Thabit mentioned that Anas said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, came up to me while I was playing
with the other boys and greeted us. He sent me on an errand and I was
late coming back to my mother. When I came, she said, \'What kept you?\'
I said, \'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, sent me on an errand.\' She said, \'What errand?\' I said, \'It
is a secret.\' She said, \'Do not tell anyone the secret of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.\'\" Anas
said, \"By Allah, if I were to tell it to anyone, I would tell it to
you, Thabit.\" \[Muslim\]

have agreed to it.\"* (16:91) The Almighty says*, \"O you who believe!
Fulfil your contracts,*\" (5:1) and the Almighty says, *\"O you who

Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"If anyone has
four characteristics, he is a pure hypocrite, and if anyone has one of

trusted, he betrays his trust; whenever he speaks, he lies; whenever he
makes an agreement, he breaks it; and whenever he quarrels, he deviates
from the truth speaks falsely.\" \[Agreed upon\]

691\. Jabir ibn \'Abdullah said, \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and

Prophet had died. When the money of Bahrayn arrived, Abu Bakr commanded
that it be announced, \'Whoever has a promise from the Prophet, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, or a debt should come to us.\' I
came to him and said, \'The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, told me such-and-such.\' He gave me a double handful and I
counted them and there were five hundred. He said, \'Take twice as much
again.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

> Allah Almighty says, *\"Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and
> fair admonition.\"* (16:125)

699\. From Abu Wa\'il Shaqiq ibn Salama said, \"Ibn Mas\'ud used to
teach us every Thursday. A man said to him, \'Abu \'Abdu\'r-Rahman, I
wish that you would teach us every day.\' He said, \'I am prevented from
doing that because I do not want to bore you and I admonish you again
and again, as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him

the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a man
among the people sneezed and I said, \'May Allah show you mercy.\' The
people looked hard at me and I said, \'May your parents be bereaved! Why
are you looking at me?\' They began to hit their hands on their thighs.
Then I saw that they were trying to make me be silent so I was silent.
When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
had finished praying - may my father and mother be his ransom, I have
never seen a better teacher before or after him - by Allah, he did not
rebuke me or hit me or abuse me. He merely said, \'It is not fitting to
have any speech from people in the prayer. It is only glorification and
proclaiming Allah great and reciting the Qur\'an.\' Or as the Messenger
of Allah said. I said, \'Messenger of Allah, I was until recently in a
state of pre-Islamic ignorance but Islam has now come to us. There are
still men among us who go to the soothsayers.\' He said, \'Do not go to
them.\' I said, \'Among us there are still men who follow omens.\' He
said, \'That is something which they find in their breasts. They should
not be influenced by them.\'\" \[Muslim\]

702\. Al-\'Irbad ibn Sariya said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, admonished us with an admonishment which
made the hearts fearful and the eyes weep.\" \[at-Tirmidhi\] He
mentioned the hadith and it was already given in full in the chapter on
preservation of the Sunna. (Hadith 157)

**92. Chapter: On Dignity and calmness**

> Allah Almighty says, *\"The slaves of the All Merciful are those who
> walk lightly on the earth and, who, when the ignorant speak to them,
> say, \'Peace.\'\"* (25:63)

703\. \'A\'isha said, \"I never saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, laugh so much that the inside of his

knowledge and other forms of worship with calmness and dignity**

> So fear Allah and do not shame me with my guests. Is there not one
> rightly-guided man among you?\'\"* (W11:77; H11:78)

706\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day
should honour his guest. Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day,
should maintain ties of kinship. Anyone who believes in Allah and the
Last Day, should speak well or be silent.\" \[Agreed upon\]

Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say,

pearls in the Garden, in which there is no shouting and no fatigue.\"
\[Agreed upon\]

709\. Abu Musa al-Ash\'ari did *wudu\'* in his house and then went out
and said, \"I will stay close to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and be with him on this day.\" He went to the
mosque and asked where the Prophet was and they said, \"He went there.\"
He said, \"I followed after him asking about him until he entered the
Well of Aris. I sat at the gate until the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had finished and was doing wudu\'. I went
up to him and he was sitting at the Well of Aris on the middle of the
rim with his legs dangling into the well. I greeted him and then went
and sat at the gate. I said, \'I will be the doorkeeper of the Messenger
of Allah today.\' Abu Bakr came and knocked at the door. I said, \'Who
is it?\' He said, \'Abu Bakr.\' I said, \'Hold on!\' I went and said,
\'Messenger of Allah, it is Abu Bakr asking permission to come in.\' He
said, \'Let him in and give him the good news of the Garden.\' I went
and said to Abu Bakr, \'Enter and the Messenger of Allah gives you the
good news of the Garden.\' Abu Bakr went in and sat at the right side of
the Prophet on the rim and dangled his feet in the well as the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had done, uncovering
his legs. Then I went back and sat down. I had left my brother at home
doing wudu\' intending to join me. I said, \'If Allah desires good for
someone\' - meaning his brother - \'He will bring him.\' Then a man
moved the gate and I said, \'Who is it?\' He said, \'\'Umar ibn
al-Khattab.\' I said, \'Hold on!\' Then I went to the Messenger of Allah
and greeted him and said, \'It is \'Umar asking permission to come in.\'
He said, \'Let him in and give him the good news of the Garden.\' I went
to \'Umar and said, \'Enter and the Messenger of Allah gives you the
good news of the Garden.\' \'Umar went in and sat at the left side of
the Prophet on the rim and dangled his feet in the well like the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Then I went
back and sat down. I said, \'If Allah desires good for someone\' -
meaning his brother - \'He will bring him.\' Then a man moved the gate
and I said, \'Who is it?\' He said, \'\'Uthman ibn \'Affan.\' I said,
\'Hold on!\' Then I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and told him. He said, \'Let him in and give him the good
news of the Garden as well as an affliction which will befall him.\' I
came and said, \'Enter and the Messenger of Allah gives you the good
news of the Garden as well as an affliction which will befall you.\' He
entered and found the rim fully occupied, so he sat opposite them on the
other side.\" Sa\'id ibn al-Musayyab said, \"I interpreted it as their
graves.\" \[Agreed upon\]

There is an addition in a variant, \"The Messenger of Allah commanded me
to guard the door.\" Also, \"When \'Uthman was given the good news, he
praised Allah Almighty and then said, \'Allah is the One who is asked
for help.\'\"

710\. Abu Hurayra said, \"We were sitting around the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and Abu Bakr and \'Umar were
among us in a group and the Messenger of Allah rose up from among us and
was slow in coming back to us and we were afraid that something had
happened to him while he was not with us. We were alarmed and got up. I
was the first to be alarmed and I went out to look for the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and I came upon him in a
garden belonging to the Ansar belonging to the Banu\'n-Najjar. I walked
round it to see if I could find its door but I did not find it. There
was a brook which flowed into the garden from a well outside it. A brook
is a small stream and I crawled along it and got inside to where the
Messenger of Allah was. He said, \'Abu Hurayra?\' I said, \'Yes,
Messenger of Allah.\' He said, \'What are you doing?\' I said, \'You
were among us and then you got up and were slow coming back to us and we
were afraid that something had happened to you and became alarmed. I was
the first to be alarmed and I came to this garden and crawled along like
a fox does. The others are behind me.\' He said, \'Abu Hurayra!\' and he
gave me his sandals. He said, \'Take these two sandals of mine and give
the good news of the Garden to whoever you meet in front of this garden
who testifies that \"There is no god but Allah\", his heart being
certain of it.\'\" He mentioned the full hadith. \[Muslim\]

711\. Shamasa said, \"We were with \'Amr ibn al-\'As when he was near to
death. He wept for a long time and turned his face to the wall. His son
began to say, \'Father, did not the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, give you the good news of that? Did not the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, give you
the good news of that?\' He turned his face and said, \'The best we can
prepare is the testimony of \"There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is
the Messenger of Allah.\" I have been through three stages. I remember
when there was no one with greater enmity for the Messenger of Allah,may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, than I and I wanted nothing more
than to have power over him so I could kill him. If I had died in that
state, I would have been one of the people of the Fire. When Allah put
Islam into my heart, I came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and said, \'Extend your right hand so that I can offer
you allegiance.\' He stretched out his right hand and I withdrew my
hand. He said, \'What is wrong, \'Amr?\' I said, \'I want to make a
condition.\' He said, \'What is your condition?\' I said, \'That I be
forgiven.\' He said, \'Do you not know that Islam wipes out everything
before it and that emigration wipes out everything before it and that
the pilgrimage wipes out everything before it?\' There was no one I
loved more than the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, and no one was more esteemed in my eyes than him. I could not
look him full in the face out of respect for him. If I were to be asked
to describe him, I would not be able to because I could not look him
full in the face. If I had died in that state, I hope that I would have
been one of the people of the Garden. Then we were put in charge of
things and I do not know what my state is in respect of them. When I
die, no female mourner nor fire should accompany me. When you bury me,
then throw the earth over me gently. Then stand around my grave for as
long as it takes to slaughter a camel and divide its meat so that I can
be comforted by you and see what answer I should make to the messengers
of my Lord.\" \[Muslim\]

**96. Chapter: On someone saying farewell and his advice when he departs
on a journey and supplication for him and by him**

> Allah Almighty says, *\"Ibrahim directed his sons to this, as did

712\. There is the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam which was already included
in the chapter of honouring the people of the House of the Messenger of
Allah. He said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, stood up to speak to us. He praised and glorified Allah and
warned and reminded. Then he said, \'O people, I am a mortal to whom the
messenger of my Lord is about to come and I will answer. I am leaving
two great things among you. The first of them is the Book of Allah which
contains guidance and light. So take the Book of Allah and cling firmly
to it.\' He promoted the Book of Allah and stimulated our desire for it.
Then he said, \'The people of my House. I remind you of Allah in respect
of the people of my House.\'\" \[Muslim\]

713\. Abu Sulayman Malik ibn al-Huwayrith said, \"We went to the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we were a group of
young men. We stayed with him for twenty days and the Prophet was kind
and merciful. He thought that we were missing our families and asked
about those we had left behind. He said, \'Return to your country and
stay among them, teach them and instruct them. They should pray
such-and-such at such-and-such a time and such-and-such a prayer at
such-and-such a time. When it is time for prayer, one of you should give
the *adhan* and the oldest of you should be the Imam \" \[Agreed upon\]

714\. \'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, \"I asked the Prophet\'s permission to

forget us in your supplication.\' He spoke a word which I would not be
happy to exchange for the whole of this world.\" \[Abu Dawud and
at-Tirmidhi\]

In one variant, he said, \"Give us a share in your supplication, my
brother.\"

715\. Salim ibn \'Abdullah ibn \'Umar reported that \'Abdullah ibn
\'Umar used to say to a man when he was about to travel, \"Come near to
me so that I can say farewell to you as the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say farewell to us, saying,
\'I commend to Allah your deen and your trust and your final actions.\"
\[at-Tirmidhi\]

716\. \'Abdullah ibn Yazid al-Khatmi the Companion said, \"When the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, wanted to
say farewell to the army, he said, \'I commend to Allah your deen and
your trust and your final actions.\'\" \[Abu Dawud\]

717\. Anas said, \"A man came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and said, \'Messenger of Allah, I want to travel, so
provision me.\' He said, \'May Allah provision you with *taqwa*.\' He
said, \'Give me more.\' He said, \'And forgive your wrong actions.\' He
said, \'Give me more.\' He said, \'And may He make good easy for you
wherever you are.\'\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

> Allah says, *\"consult with them about the matter,\"* (3:159) and the
> Almighty says, *\"who manage their affairs by mutual consultation.\"*
> (W42:35; H42:38)

718\. Jabir said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, used to teach us the *istikhara*, asking for the good
in all matters, as he would teach us a sura of the Qur\'an. He said,
\'When one of you is intending to do something, he should pray two
*rak\'ats* outside the obligatory prayer and then say, \'O Allah, I ask
You for the best by Your knowledge and I ask You for strength by Your
power and I ask You for some of Your immense bounty. You have power and
I do not. You know and I do not. You are the Knower of the Unseen
worlds. O Allah, if You know that this matter is good for me in my deen
and my livelihood and the end of my affair (or he said, \'my affair
sooner and later\'), then ordain it for me and make it easy for me and
then bless me in it. If You know that this matter is bad for me in my
deen and my livelihood and the end of my affair (or he said, \'my affair
sooner and later\'), then avert it from me and avert me from it and
ordain something better for me wherever it may lie and make me content
with it.\' He added, \'Then he should name the thing he wants to do.\'\"

Messenger of Allah?\' He said, \'I am the Messenger of Allah. If harm
befalls you, my supplication will remove it from you. If a year of
drought afflicts you, my supplication will make things grow for you.
When you are in an empty land or wilderness and lose your mount, my
supplication will return it to you.\'\" He said, \'I said, \'Advise
me.\' He said, \'Do not abuse anyone. (He said, \"After that I abused
neither free man or slave, nor a camel or a sheep.\") Do not disdain any
act of kindness. And speaking to your brother with a cheerful face is
part of being kind. Raise your waist-wrapper to the middle of your
calves. If you refuse, then to the ankles, but beware of dragging the
wrapper. It is part of arrogance and Allah does not love arrogance. If a
man insults you and criticises you for what he knows about you, do not
criticise him for what you know concerning him. The bad effects of that
are suffered by him.\'\" \[Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi\]

\'Messenger of Allah, why did you command him to do wudu\' and then
ignore his doing it?\' He said, \'He was praying with his wrapper
hanging down. Allah does not accept the prayer of a man who has it
hanging down.\" \[Abu Dawud\]

798\. Qays ibn Bishr at-Taghlibi said, \"My father, who used to sit with
Abu\'d-Darda\', reported to me, \'There was one of the Companions of the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in Damascus called
Sahl ibn al-Hanzaliyya. He was a man who liked to be alone and he rarely
sat with other people. They would pray and when the prayer was finished,
he would do glorification and takbir until he returned to his family. He
passed by us once when we were with Abu\'d-Darda\'. Abu\'d-Darda\' said
to him, \"A word will benefit us and not harm you.\" He said, \"The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent out an
expedition and it returned. One of the men from it came and sat in the
group in which the Messenger of Allah was sitting. The man said to his
neighbour, \'If only you had seen us when we met the enemy! So-and-so
attacked and stabbed and said, \"Take this from me. I am the Ghifari
lad.\" What do you think of his words?\' He said, \'I only think that
his reward is negated.\' Another heard it and said, \'I do not see any
harm in that.\' They quarrelled until the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, heard and said, \'Glory be to Allah!
There is nothing wrong with being both rewarded and also given
praise.\'\" I saw Abu\'d-Darda\' delighted by that and he lifted his
head to him and said, \"You really heard that from the Messenger of
Allah?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He continued saying that to him until I said,
\"He will end up on his knees.\'\"

\"\'He said, \'He passed by us another day and Abu\'d-Darda\' said to
him, \"A word will benefit us and not harm you.\" He said, \"The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to us,
\'Anyone who spends to look after horses is like someone who holds out
his hand to give sadaqa and never withdraws it.\'\"

\"\'Then he passed by us another day and Abu\'d-Darda\' said to him, \"A
word will benefit us and not harm you.\" He said, \"The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \'What an
excellent man is Khuraym al-Asadi if only it had not been for the length
of his hair and the dragging of his wrapper!\' That reached Khuraym and
he hastened to get hold of a knife and cut his hair to ear length and
raised his waist-wrapper to the middle of his calves.\"

\"\'Then he passed by us another day and Abu\'d-Darda\' said to him, \"A
word will benefit us and not harm you.\" He said, \"I heard the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \'You

than the ankles is in the Fire. Allah will not look at anyone who drags
his wrapper out of pride.\" \[Abu Dawud\]

> One does not do what many common people recite, *\"Allah and His

935\. Abu \'Abdu\'r-Rahman \'Awf ibn Malik said, \"The Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, conducted a funeral
prayer and I memorised some of his supplication. He said, \'O Allah,
forgive him, show mercy to him, protect him, pardon him, make his place
in the Garden noble and make the grave he is entering wide. Wash him
with water snow and hail. Cleanse him of errors as a white garment is
cleansed of dirt. Give him a better home in exchange for his home, and a
better family than his family and a better wife than his wife and admit
him to the Garden. Give him refuge from the punishment of the grave and
the punishment of the Fire\' so that I wished that I could have been
that dead person.\" \[Muslim\]

936\. Abu Hurayra, Abu Qatada and Abu Ibrahim al-Ashhali from his father
who was a Companion that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, prayed in a funeral, saying, \"O Allah, forgive our living and
our dead, our young and our old, our male and our female, our present
and our absent. O Allah, whoever among us You make live, make him live
in Islam, whoever of us you make die, make him die in belief. O Allah,
do not deprive us of his reward and do not tempt us after him.\"

\[At-Tirmidhi related it from Abu Hurayra and al-Ashhali. Abu Dawud
related it from Abu Hurayra and Abu Qatada. At-Tirmidhi said that
al-Bukhari said, \"The soundest of the variants of this hadith is that
of al-Ashhali.\" Al-Bukhari said, \"The soundest thing in this area is
the hadith of \'Awf ibn Malik.\"\]

937\. Abu Hurayra said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, \'When you pray over a dead person,
devote your supplication to him.\'\" \[Abu Dawud\]

938\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said in the prayer on the dead, \"O Allah, You are his
Lord and You created him. You guided him to Islam and You took his soul.
You know best his secret and what he made public. We have come to You as
his intercessors, so forgive him.\" \[Abu Dawud\]

939\. Wathila ibn al-Asqa\' said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, led us in the funeral prayer for a man of
the Muslims. I heard him say, \'O Allah, so-and-so son of so-and-so is
in Your keeping and under Your protection. Protect him from the trial of
the grave and the punishment of the Fire. You are worthy of loyalty and
praise. O Allah, forgive him and show mercy to him, You are the
Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\'\" \[Abu Dawud\]

940\. \'Abdullah ibn Abi Awfa said four *takbirs* for the funeral prayer
of one of his daughters. He stood after the fourth for as long as he
stood between the last two *takbirs*, asking forgiveness for her and
making supplication. Then he said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, used to do the same as that.\"

In one variant, \"He said the *takbir* four times and then remained for
a while until I thought that he would say a fifth *takbir*. Then he said
the Salam to his right and his left. When he finished, we said to him,
\'What is this?\' He said, \'I do not add to what I saw the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, do - or the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to do the same as
that.\'\" \[al-Hakim\]

**158. Chapter: On carrying the bier quickly**

941\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"Carry the bier quickly. If the dead person was
righteous, it is good you are advancing him to. If he was other than
that, then it is an evil your are removing from your necks.\" \[Agreed
upon\]

942\. Abu Sa\'id al-Khudri reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"When a body is laid out and the men
carry it on their shoulders, if it was righteous, it says, \'Take me
forward,\' and it was it not righteous, it says, \'Woe to me, where are
you taking it?\'\' Everything except man hears its voice. If he were to
hear it, he would faint.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

**159. Chapter: On First settling the debts of the deceased and making
haste to prepare him for burial unless he died suddenly, in which case
he is left until one is sure of death**

grant him peace, said, \"The soul of the believer is held back because
of a debt until it is paid for him.\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

944\. Husayn ibn Wahwah reported that Talha ibn al-Bara\' became ill and
the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to visit him

bring him quickly. The corpse of a Muslim should not be kept among his
family.\" \[Abu Dawud\]

**160. Chapter: On admonition at the grave**

945\. \'Ali said, \"We took part in a funeral prayer in Baqi\'
al-Gharqad. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came
to us and sat and we sat around him. He was holding a stick and he
lowered his head and began to strike the ground with his stick. Then he
said, \'There is none of you, nor any created soul, who does not have
his place written for him in the Garden or the Fire.\' They said,
\'Messenger of Allah, should we then rely on what is written for us? \'
He said, \'Act. For that which he has been created for is made easy for
every man.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

**161. Chapter: On supplication for the deceased after his burial and
staying at the grave for a time for supplication, asking forgiveness and
recitation**

946\. Abu \'Amr, and it is said Abu \'Abdullah or Abu Layla, \'Uthman
ibn \'Affan said, \"When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, finished burying a dead person, he used to stand over him and
say, \'Ask forgiveness for your brother and ask for steadfastness for
him. Now he is being questioned.\'\" \[Abu Dawud\]

947\. Abu \'Amr ibn al-\'As said, \"When you bury me, then stand around
my grave for as long as it takes to slaughter a camel and divide its
meat so that I can be comforted by you and see what answer I should make
to the messengers of my Lord.\" \[Muslim\]

Ash-Shafi\'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"It is recommended to
recite some of the Qur\'an in his presence. It is good if the entire
Qur\'an is recited in his presence.\"

**162. Chapter: On *sadaqa* and supplication for the deceased**

> Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in belief.\'\"*
> (59:10)

948\. \'A\'isha reported that a man said to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, \"My mother died, and I think that if she had
spoken, she would have given sadaqa. Will she have a reward if I give
*sadaqa* on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" \[Agreed upon\]

949\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"When a man dies, his actions are cut
off except for three -- an on-going *sadaqa* and knowledge which brought
benefit and a virtuous son who makes supplication for him.\" \[Muslim\]

**163. Chapter: On people praising the dead person**

950\. Anas said, \"A funeral procession passed by and they were praising
the dead man. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, \'It is mandatory.\' Then another passed and they were speaking
ill of the dead man. He said, \'It is mandatory.\' \'Umar ibn al-Khattab
said, \'What is mandatory?\' He said, \'You praised this one, and so the
Garden is mandatory for him and you spoke evil of this one, so the Fire
is mandatory for him. You are the witnesses of Allah on the earth.\'\"
\[Agreed upon\]

951\. Abu\'l-Aswad said, \"I came to Madina and was sitting with \'Umar
ibn al-Khattab when a funeral passed by and the dead man was praised.
\'Umar said, \'It is mandatory.\' Then another passed by and they
praised the dead. \'Umar said, \'It is mandatory.\' Then a third passed
by and they spoke ill of the dead. \'Umar said, \'It is mandatory.\'\"
Abu\'l-Aswad said, \"I said, \'What is mandatory, Amir al-Mu\'minin?\'
He said, \'I say as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, \"Any Muslim to whose goodness four people testify, will be
admitted by Allah to the Garden.\" We said, \"And if three do?\" He
said, \"Three as well.\" We said, \"And two.\" He said, \"Two also.\"
Then we did not ask him about one.\'\" \[al-Bukhari\]

**164. Chapter: The excellence of the one who dies leaving young
children**

952\. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"No Muslim has three of children die before

His mercy to them.\" \[Agreed upon\]

Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, \'Messenger of
Allah, the men hear all your hadith, so appoint a day for us in which we
can come to you and you can teach us some of what Allah has taught
you.\' He said, \'Meet on such-and-such a day\' They met and the Prophet
came to them and taught them some of what Allah had taught him. Then he
said, \'If any woman has three of her children die, they will act as a
screen from the Fire.\' A woman said, \'And two?\' He said, \'And
two.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

**165. Chapter: On weeping and fear when passing the graves and ruins of
the wrongdoers, and displaying need of Allah and cautioning against
being unmindful of that**

955\. Ibn \'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to his Companions when they reached
al-Hijr, the houses of Thamud, \"Do not enter places of people on whom
punishment has fallen without weeping. If you do not weep do not enter
them, lest what befell them befalls you.\" \[Agreed upon\]

In one variant he says, \"When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, passed by al-Hijr, he said, \'Do not enter the
houses of those who wronged themselves without weeping lest what befell
them befalls you.\' Then the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, bowed his head and quickened his pace until he had
passed the valley.\"
