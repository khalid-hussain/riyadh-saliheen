guard the tongue**

1511\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day,
should speak good words or be silent.\" \[Agreed upon\]

This hadith clearly indicates that he should not speak unless the words
he speaks are good. That means speech whose benefit is clear. If there
is any doubt about benefit occurring, he should not speak.

1512\. Abu Musa said, \"I said, \'Messenger of Allah, whose Islam is
best?\' He said, \'The one from whose tongue and hands the Muslims are
safe.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Anyone who safeguards for My sake
what is between his jaws and what is between his legs, I will safeguard
the Garden for him.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1514\. Abu Hurayra reported that he heard the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, \"A slave of Allah might say something,
without realising its seriousness, which causes him to slip into the
Fire by a greater margin than the distance between the east and the
west.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1515\. Abu Hurayra is that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, \"A slave of Allah might say something which pleases
Allah Almighty without realising it on account of which Allah raises him
some degrees. A slave of Allah might say something which angers Allah
Almighty without realising it on account of which he falls into
Jahannam.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

1516\. Abu \'Abdu\'r-Rahman Bilal ibn al-Harith al-Muzani reported that
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
\"A man may say something which pleases Allah Almighty without him
realising the full extent of its implication, and because of it, Allah
prescribes His pleasure for him until the Day he meets Him. And a man
may likewise say something which angers Allah without him realising the
full extent of its implication, and because of it, Allah prescribes His
wrath for him until the Day he meets Him. \[Malik in al-Muwatta\' and
at-Tirmidhi\]

1517\. Sufyan ibn \'Abdullah said, \"I said, \'Messenger of Allah, tell
me something I can cling to.\' He said, \'Say: \"My Lord is Allah\" and
then go straight.\' I said, \'Messenger of Allah, what is the thing you
fear most for me?\' He took hold of his tongue and then said,
\'This.\'\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

1518\. Ibn \'Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"Do not say much without mentioning
Allah. A lot of talk without mentioning Allah Almighty makes people\'s
hearts hard. The furthest of people from Allah are the hard-hearted.\"
\[at-Tirmidhi\]

1519\. Abu Hurayra said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, \'Anyone whom Allah protects from the evil of
what is between his jaws and the evil of what is between his legs will
enter the Garden.\'\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

1520\. \'Uqba ibn \'Amir said, \"I said, \'Messenger of Allah, what
ensures safety?\' He said, \'Holding your tongue, keeping to your house
and weeping for your sins.\'\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

1521\. Abu Sa\'id al-Khudri reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"When the son of Adam starts the day,
all his limbs supplicate his tongue, saying, \'Fear Allah in respect of
us. We move by you. If you go straight, we go straight. If you go
crooked, we go crooked.\'\" \[at-Tirmidhi\]

1522\. Mu\'adh said, \"I said, \'Messenger of Allah, tell me of an
action which will admit me to the Garden and keep me far from the
Fire.\' He said, \'You have asked about a great matter, but it is easy
for the one to whom Allah Almighty makes it easy: worship Allah and do
not associate anything with Him, do the prayer, pay the zakat, fast
Ramadan and go on hajj to the House.\' Then he said, \'Shall I direct
you to the gates of good? Fasting, which is a protection, and *sadaqa*,
which extinguishes mistakes as water extinguishes fire, and the prayer
of a man in the middle of the night.\' Then he recited, *\'Their sides
eschew their beds\'* until he reached *\'what it used to do.\'
(32:16-17)* Then he said, \'Shall I tell you of the head of the matter,
its support and its peak?\' I said, \'Yes indeed, Messenger of Allah.\'
He said, \'The head of the matter is Islam and its support is the prayer
and its peak is jihad.\' Then he said, \'Shall I tell you of the
foundation of all that?\' I said, \'Yes, indeed, Messenger of Allah.\'
He took hold of his tongue and said, \'Restrain this.\' I said,
\'Messenger of Allah, will we be taken to task for what we say ?\' He
said, \'May your mother be bereaved! Are people thrown on their faces
into the Fire for anything but the harvest of their tongues?\'\"
\[at-Tirmidhi\]

1523\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"Do you know what backbiting is?\" They
said, \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" He said, \"To mention your
brother in a manner he dislikes.\" It was said, \"What if my brother is
as I say?\" He said, \"If he is as you said, you have backbitten him. If
he is not as you said, you have slandered him.\" \[Muslim\]

1524\. Abu Bakra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said in his khutba on the Day of Sacrifice
during the Farewell Hajj, \"Your blood, your property and your honour
are sacred to you, like the sacredness of this day in this month in this
city. Have I not conveyed it?\" \[Agreed upon\]

1525\. \'A\'isha said, \"I said to the Prophet, \'Such-and-such should
be enough for you in respect of Safiyya.\' (Some of the transmitters say
that she meant her shortness.) He said, \'You have said something that,

\[She said,\] I said, \'I related something unpleasant about someone to
him and he said, \"I would not like to relate anything unpleasant about

it\].\"\'\" \[Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi\]

1526\. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, \"When I ascended through the heavens, I

\'Those are the people who consumed people\'s flesh and attacked their
honour.\'\" \[Abu Dawud\]

him and grant him peace, said, \"The blood, honour and property of every
Muslim is sacred for another Muslim.\" \[Muslim\]

**255. Chapter: On the prohibition against listening to backbiting. The
command that someone who hears backbiting should refute it or object to
it being said. If he is unable to do that or the speaker does not accept
his objection, then he should leave that gathering if he can.**

> Allah Almighty says, *\"When they hear worthless talk, they turn away
> from it,\"* (28:55) and the Almighty says, *\"Those who turn away from
> worthless talk.\"* (23:3) The Almighty says, *\"Hearing, sight and

> wrongdoers.\"* (6:68)

1528\. Abu\'d-Darda\' reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and

reported from him in the chapter on hope, \"The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up to pray and said, \'Where
is Malik ibn ad-Dukhshum?\' A man said, \'That man is a hypocrite who
does not love Allah and His Messenger.\' The Prophet said, \'Do not say
that. Do you not see that he has said, \"There is no god but Allah,\"
desiring by that only the face of Allah? Allah has forbidden the Fire
for anyone who says \"There is no god but Allah\" desiring by that the
face of Allah.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

1530\. Ka\'b ibn Malik said in his long hadith about the story of his
repentance which was given in the Chapter of Repentance, \"While he was
sitting among the people at Tabuk, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \'What has Ka\'b ibn Malik done? A man of the
Banu Salima said, \'O Messenger of Allah, he has been held back by his
two cloaks and self-conceit.\' Mu\'adh ibn Jabal said to him, \'What an
evil thing to say! By Allah, Messenger of Allah, we only know good of
him!\' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was silent.\" \[Agreed upon\]

**256. Chapter: On what is permitted in talking about people**

> Know that talking about people is permitted for a sound legal reason
> which can only be realised by doing that. There are six reasons for
> which it is allowed:
>
> 1\. Being a victim of injustice. The person who has been wronged is
> permitted to complain about that to the ruler or qadi or others in
> authority or those who have the power to rectify the injustice. He
> says, \"So-and-so has wronged me.\"
>
> 2\. Seeking help to alter something objectionable or to return someone
> who disobeys Allah to the correct path. He says to the one he hopes
> will remove what is objectionable (*munkar*), \"So-and-so is doing
> such-and-such, so restrain him from it. That is allowed if his aim is
> to remove that objectionable. Otherwise it is forbidden.
>
> 3\. Asking for a fatwa. He says to the mufti, \"My father (brother,
> spouse or so-and-so) has wronged me by such-and-such. Can he do that?
> How can I be saved from it and obtain my right and remove the
> injustice?\" This is permitted as it is legal argument, but it is
> better to be more circumspect and say, \"What do you say about a man,
> person or spouse who does such-and-such?\" Then he will obtain what he
> desires without mentioning him specifically, although it is
> nonetheless permitted to mention him specifically.
>
> 4\. Warning the Muslims about evil and advising them. There are
> various forms of that. Part of that is invalidating the testimony of
> witnesses and transmitters. That is permitted by consensus. Indeed, it
> is mandatory because of need. Another instance is consultation about
> someone as a potential in-law, partner, keeper of a deposit or
> employee, or the like, or neighbour. Then the one consulted must not
> conceal his state and must mention his bad qualities with the aim of
> giving good advice. Another case is when someone sees someone learning
> fiqh frequenting an innovator or impious person to study with them and
> he fears that the student of fiqh will be harmed by that. Then he must
> give him good advice by explaining the person\'s situation, always
> provided that his intention is to give advice. This is something in
> which it is possible to err and the speaker may be moved by envy to do
> that and Shaytan confuses the matter for him so that he imagines that
> it is good advice. Another case is when someone has guardianship which
> he does not administer properly, either because he does not deal
> properly with it, or is impious or neglectful or the like. Then it is
> obliged to mention that to the one with general authority so that he
> can remove it and appoint someone who will look after it properly, or
> in order that he knows that about him so that he can deal with him
> appropriately and not be deceived by him.
>
> 5\. When someone is open about his impiety or innovation, like someone
> who drinks wine openly, oppresses people, imposes tolls on people and
> taxes property unjustly and engages in false matters. What he does
> openly is mentioned, but it is forbidden to mention other faults he
> has unless it is for another justifiable cause.
>
> 6\. Recognition. When a person is known by a nickname, like al-A\'mash
> (the blear-eyed), al-A\'raj (the lame), al-Asamm (the deaf), and the
> like, it is permitted that they be known as that but it is forbidden
> to use it to deprecate them. It is better if there is another way of
> identifying the person.
>
> These are six reasons which scholars mentioned and there is agreement
> on most of them. The evidence for that in sound hadiths is well-known.

1531\. \'A\'isha reported that a man asked permission to visit the
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said, \'Give
him permission. He is an evil brother of the tribe.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

Al-Bukhari used it as a proof for the permissibility of speaking ill of
the people of corruption and people of doubt.

1532\. \'A\'isha reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"I do not think that so-and-so and
so-and-so know anything about our deen.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

Al-Layth ibn Sa\'d, one of the transmitters of this hadith, said,
\"These two men were among the hypocrites.\"

1533\. Fatima bint Qays said, \"I went to the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, and said, \'Abu\'l-Jahm and Mu\'awiya have both
proposed marriage to me.\' The Messenger of Allah said, \'Mu\'awiya is
poor and without property. Abu\'l-Jahm does not put down the staff from
his shoulder.\'\" \[Agreed upon\]

In a version of Muslim, \"As for Abu\'l-Jahm, he beats women,\" which
explains the transmission, \"He does not put down the staff from his
shoulder.\" It is also said to mean he travels a lot.

1534\. Zayd ibn Arqam said, \"We went out with the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a journey during which the
people suffered considerable hardship. \'Abdullah ibn Ubayy said, \'Do
not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah so that they
become disunited.\' He said, \'When we return to Madina, the mightier
will drive out the humbler from it.\' I went to the Messenger of Allah
and told him that and he sent for \'Abdullah ibn Ubayy who took a strong
oath swearing that he had not said it. They said, \'Zayd has lied to the
Messenger of Allah,\" and I felt great distress inside me because of
what they had said until Allah Almighty sent down a confirmation (of
what I had said): *\'When the hypocrites come to you\...\'* (63). Then
the Messenger of Allah , may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
invited them in order to ask forgiveness for them but they arrogantly
turned their heads away.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1535\. \'A\'isha said, \"Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan, asked the
Prophet, \'Abu Sufyan is miserly and does not give me enough for me and
my children unless I take it from him without his knowledge.\' He said,
\'Take what is reasonably enough for you and your children.\'\" \[Agreed
upon\]

**257. Chapter: On the prohibition against slander, which is carrying
tales between people in order to create trouble**

> Allah says, *\"A backbiter, slandermonger,\"* (68:11) and He says,
> *\"He does not utter a single word without a watcher by him, pen in
> hand.*\" (50:18)

1536\. Hudhayfa reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"A slanderer will not enter the
Garden.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1537\. Ibn \'Abbas reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, passed by two graves and said, \"They are being
punished and not for anything very great. One of them did not guard
himself from urine and the other was involved in back-biting.\" \[Agreed
upon\]

The scholars say the meaning of \"not for anything very great\" is as
they claim.

1538\. Ibn Mas\'ud reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"Shall I tell you what slander is? It is
backbiting bandied about among people.\" \[Muslim\]

**258. Chapter: On the prohibition against carrying tales and things
that people have said to those in authority if there is no need for
that, for instance, fear of corruption, etc.**

> Allah Almighty says, *\"Do not help one another to wrongdoing and
> enmity.\"* (5:2)

1539\. Ibn Mas\'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"None of my Companions should convey to
me anything bad about someone else. I want to come out to you with a
clear heart.\" \[Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi\]

**259. Chapter: on the censure of being two-faced**

> Allah Almighty says, *\"They try to conceal themselves from people,
> but they cannot conceal themselves from Allah. He is with them when
> they spend the night saying things which are not pleasing to Him.
> Allah encompasses everything they do.\"* (W4:107;4:108)

1540\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"You will find people to be mines. The
best of them in the *Jahiliyya* are the best of them in Islam when they
have understanding. You will find the best of people in this business
(of command) to be those who dislike it the most, and you will find the
worst of people are the two-faced who come to these people with one face
and those people with another face.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1541\. Muhammad ibn Zayd said that some people said to his grandfather,
\'Abdullah ibn \'Umar, \"We visit our sultans and speak differently to
them than we do when we leave them.\" He said, \"In the time of the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, we used to
consider this hypocrisy.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

**260. Chapter: On the prohibition against lying**

> Allah Almighty says, *\"Do not pursue what you have no knowledge
> of,\"* (17:36) and the Almighty says*, \"He does not utter a single
> word without a watcher by him, pen in hand.\"* (50:18)

1542\. Ibn Mas\'ud stated that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"Truthfulness leads to piety and piety
leads to the Garden. A man should be truthful until he is written down
as truthful with Allah. Lying leads to deviance and deviance leads to
the Fire. A man will lie until he is written down as a liar with
Allah.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1543\. \'Abdullah ibn \'Amr is that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"If anyone has four characteristics, he is a
pure hypocrite, and if anyone has one of them, he has an aspect of
hypocrisy until he gives it up: whenever he is trusted, he betrays his
trust; whenever he speaks, he lies; when he makes an agreement, he
breaks it; and when he quarrels, he deviates from the truth by speaking
falsely.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1544\. Ibn \'Abbas reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"Anyone who relates a dream which he has not
really had will have to tie a knot between two grains of barley and will
not be able to do it. Anyone who listens to people talking when they do
not want him to, will have molten lead poured into his ears on the Day
of Rising. Anyone who makes an image will be punished and have to breath
a spirit into it but will not be able to do it.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

1545\. Ibn \'Umar reported said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, \"The worst of lies is when a man says his
eyes have seen something which they have not seen.\" \[al-Bukhari\]

It means that he says he has dreamt what he did not dream.

1546\. Samura ibn Jundub said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, would often say to his Companions, \'Who among
you had a dream last night?\' Then anyone who Allah willed would recount
his dream. One morning he said to us, \'During the night two men came to
me and said to me, \"Come on!\" So I went with them. We came to a man
who was lying on his back while another man was standing over him with a
stone which he dropped onto his head and crushed it. Then the stone
rolled away from him and he went after the stone to retrieve it. When he
returned to him, his head was whole again and had become as it had been
in the first place. So he went back and hit him as he had done the first
time. I said to them, \"Glory be to Allah! Who are these two?\" They
said, \"Go on! Go on!\" We went on and came to a man lying on his back
and there was another man standing over him with an iron hook. He went
to one side of his face and cut open the side of his mouth until it
reached the back of his neck and then his nostril to the back of his
neck and his eye to the back of his neck. Then he moved to the other
side and did the same thing as he had done to first side. When he
finished that side, the first side had become whole again. Then he did
the same thing all over again.\" He said, \'I said, \"Glory be to Allah!
Who are these two?\" They said to me, \"Go on! Go on!\" and we went on
until we came upon something like an oven.\'\" I think he said, \"\'In
it was a babble and shouting. We looked down into it and it contained
naked men and women. The flames would come at them from underneath, and
when those flames reached them, they cried out. I said, \"Who are
they?\" They said, \"Go on! Go on!\" and we went on until we came to a
river.\'\" I think that he said, \"\'Red like blood. In the river there
was a man swimming and on the bank of the river was a man who had many
stones with him. When that swimmer swam and reached the one who had
gathered the stones, he force his mouth open and make him swallow a
stone. Then he would begin to swim and would come back to him again.
Whenever he came back to him, he forced open his mouth and made him
swallow a stone. I said to them, \"Who are these two?\" They said to me,
\"Go on! Go on!\" and we went on until we came to a man with a repulsive
appearance - or the most repulsive man you have ever seen. He was at a
fire which he was kindling and which he was running around. I said to
them, \"Who is this?\' They said to me, \"Go on! Go on!\" and we went on
until we came to a green meadow with every type of spring flower in it.
There was in the middle of the meadow a man so tall that I could
scarcely see his head, so high it was in the sky. Around the man were
the greatest number of children I have ever seen. I said, \"Who is this?
Who are those?\" They said to me, \"Go on! Go on!\" and we went on until
we reached a huge tree and I have never seen any tree bigger or more
beautiful than it. They said to me, \"Climb it.\" We climbed it and came
to a city built of gold and silver bricks. We came to the door of the
city and asked for it to be opened and it was opened for us and we
entered it. We were met by men half of whose physique was the most
beautiful you have ever seen and the other half was the ugliest you have
ever seen. The two said to them, \"Go and plunge into that river.\"
There was a wide river flowing there whose water was pure white. They
went and jumped into it and when they returned to us, that evil had left
them and they had the most beautiful form.\' He said, \'They said to me,
\"This is the Garden of Eden, and that is your place.\" I raised my eyes
upwards and there was a castle like a white cloud. They said to me,
\"This is your place.\" I said to them, \"May Allah bless you, let me
enter it.\" They said, \"No, not now. But you will enter it.\" I said to
them, \"This night I have seen marvels, but what are these things which
I have seen?\'\" They said to me, \"We will tell you. The first man to
whom you came whose head was being crushed with the stone is a man who
memorised the Qur\'an and then abandoned it and slept through the
obligatory prayers. As for the man you came to whose jaw was split to
his neck, whose nostril to his neck and whose eye to his neck, he was a
man who went from his house and told lies which spread everywhere. As
for the naked men and women who were in something like an oven, they
were adulterers and adulteresses. The man you came to who was swimming
in the river and being made to swallow stones used to consume usury. The
man with the disagreeable appearance who was at the fire, kindling it
and running around it was Malik, the guardian of Jahannam. The tall man
in the meadow was Ibrahim. The children who were around him are all
those who were born and died in the natural state. \[The variant of
al-Barqani has, \'born in the natural state.\'\]\'\"

One of the Muslims asked, \"Messenger of Allah, the children of the
idolaters as well?\" The Messenger of Allah said, \"The children of the
idolaters as well.\" \'\"As for the people who were half beautiful and
half ugly, they are the people who mixed righteous actions with evil
actions. Allah overlooked them.\"\'\" \[al-Bukhari\]

In one of the variants of al-Bukhari, \"But in the night I dreamt that
two men came to me and took me by the hand and brought me to the Holy
Land.\" Then he mentioned it and said, \"We went on until we came upon a
hole like an oven. Its top was narrow and its bottom wide, and there was
a fire kindled under it. When the flames flared up, the people were
lifted until they were almost out and when it subsided, they returned
into it. It contained naked men and women.\" In it is, \"until we came
to a river of blood in the middle of which there was a man standing
together with another man carrying some stones in front of him. The man
in the river came forward and when he tried to get out, the other man
threw a stone into his mouth and he went back to where he had been
before. Whenever he tried to get out, the other would throw a stone in
his mouth and he would go back to where he had been before.\" In it is,
\"The two men made me climb the tree and took me into a house which was
more beautiful than any I had ever seen. In it were some old men, young
men, women and children.\" In it is, \"As for the one you saw whose jaw
was being torn open, he was liar who told lies that were relayed from
him until they spread everywhere. So that is what will be done to him
until the Day of Rising,\" and \"The man you saw whose head was being
crushed was someone to whom Allah had taught the Qur\'an who used to
sleep without reciting it at night and did not act by it during the day.
That will be done to him until the Day of Rising.\" And, \"The first
house you entered was the house of the generality of believers. This
house is the house of those killed fighting in the way of Allah. I am
Jibril and this is Mika\'il. Raise your head.\" I raised my head and
above me was something like a cloud. They said, \"This is your destined
place.\" I said, \"Let me enter my place.\" They said, \"You still have
some of your life left which has not been completed. If it were
complete, you would have come to your place.\"

1547\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, \"It is enough of a lie for a man to talk about
everything he hears.\" \[Muslim\]

1548\. Samura reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him

Pledge of Ridwan, said that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, \"Anyone who deliberately swears a false oath
that he will adopt another religion than Islam \[if he is not telling
the truth\], it will be as he said. Anyone who kills himself with
something, will be punished with that thing on the Day of Rising. An
oath which is a man is incapable of fulfilling is not binding on him.
Cursing a believer is like killing him.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1552\. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, \"It is not fitting for a truthful man to
be someone who curses.\" \[Muslim\]

bless him and grant him peace, said, \"If a slave of Allah curses
something, the curse rises to the heaven and the gates of heaven are
locked against it. Then it falls to the earth and the gates of the earth
are locked against it and then it goes to the right and to the left and
when it does not find any entrance, it returns to that which was cursed
if it deserves it. Otherwise it returns to the one who said it.\" \[Abu
Dawud\]

1557\. \'Imran ibn al-Husayn said, \"On one of the journeys of the
Messenger of Allah there was a woman of the Ansar on a she-camel. It was
recalcitrant and she cursed it. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, heard that and said, \'Take off what is on it

it now walking among the people and no one turned to it.\" \[Muslim\]

1558\. Abu Barza Nadla ibn \'Ubayd al-Aslami said, \"On one occasion a

Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The mountains were
hemming them in and she said, \'Move! O Allah, curse it!\' The Prophet
said, \'A she-camel bearing a curse will not accompany us.\'\"
\[Muslim\]

The meaning of this hadith is unclear even if there is no unambiguity in
it. What is meant is that that camel was forbidden to accompany them. It
is not a prohibition against selling it, slaughtering it or riding it
not in the company of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace. All those uses are permitted and not forbidden with the sole
exception of being in his company. Allah knows best.

the people said, \'May Allah disgrace you!\' He said, \'Do not say that.

One variant has, \"Actions are presented every Thursday and Monday.\"

**270. Chapter: On the prohibition against envy**

him and grant him peace, said, \"If anyone has four characteristics, he
is a pure hypocrite, and if anyone has one of them, he has an aspect of
hypocrisy until he gives it up: whenever he is trusted, he betrays his
trust; whenever he speaks, he lies; when he makes an agreement, he
breaks it; and when he quarrels, he deviates from the truth, speaking
falsely.\" \[Agreed upon\]

1585\. Ibn Mas\'ud, Ibn \'Umar and Anas said, \"The Prophet, may Allah

of three people on the Day of Rising: a man who makes a covenant in My

him and grant him peace, said, \"When a man says, \'The people are
destroyed,\' then he is of all of them, the most destroyed.\'\"
\[Muslim\]

This prohibition is when the person says this out of arrogance and to
demean the people and show his elevation over them. This is what is
unlawful. If he says it because of the lack of practice of the deen
which he sees in people and says it out of sorrow for them and for the
deen, there is no harm in it. That is the explanation of the scholars.
The notable scholars who said that include Malik ibn Anas, al-Khattabi,
al-Humaydi and others. I dealt with it in Kitab al-Adhkar.

one of our companions, said in his book, al-Bahr, \"It is said that what
is meant by \'burying it\' is to remove it from the mosque. If the
mosque is paved or whitewashed and he rubs it with his shoe or something
else as many ignorant people do, that is not burying it. It is

the person who did that should wipe it with a cloth or his hand or
something else or wash it,\"
