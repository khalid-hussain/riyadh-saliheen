On dutifulness to parents and maintaining ties of kinship</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>Allah Almighty says,<i> "Worship Allah and do not associate
anything with Him. Be good to your parents and relatives and to orphans
and the very poor, and to neighbours who are related to you and neighbours
who are not related to you, and to companions and travellers and your slaves."
</i>(4:36) The Almighty says, <i>"Have taqwa of Allah in whose name you
make demands on one another and also in respect of your families,"</i>
(4:1) and the Almighty says, <i>"Those who join what Allah has commanded
to be joined." </i>(W13:23; H13:21) The Almighty says, <i>"We have instructed
man to honour his parents," </i>(W29:7; H29:8) and the Almighty says, <i>"Your
Lord has decreed: that you should worship none but Him, and that you should
show kindness to your parents, whether one or both of them reach old age
with you. So do not say 'Ugh!' to them out of irritation and do not be
harsh with them but speak to them with gentleness and generosity. Lower
to them, out of mercy, the wing of humility and say: 'Lord, show mercy
to them as they did in looking after me when I was small.'</i>" (17:23-24)
The Almighty says, <i>"We have instructed man concerning his parents. Bearing
him caused his mother great debility and the period of his weaning was
two years: 'Give thanks to Me and to your parents.'"</i> (W31:13; H31:14)</blockquote>
312. Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "I asked the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, "Which action does Allah Almighty
love the most?" He said, "The prayer in its time." I said, "Then what?"
He said, "Devotedness to parents." I said, "Then what?" He said, "Jihad
in the way of Allah." [Agreed upon]
<p>313. Abu Hurayra reported: "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "No child can repay his father unless he
finds him enslaved and then buys him and sets him free." [Muslim]
<p>314. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah said, "Anyone
who believes in Allah and the Last Day should honour his guest. Anyone
who believes in Allah and the Last Day should maintain his ties of kinship.
Anyone who believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak well or remain
silent." [Agreed upon]
<p>315. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty created creation and when
he finished creating, kinship stood up and said, 'Is this the place of
him who seeks refuge with You from being cut off?' He said, 'Yes. Would
you be pleased if I joined anyone who joined you and cut off anyone who
cut you off?' It said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Then that is the case.'" Then the
Messenger of Allah said, "If you wish, then recite, <i>'Is it not likely
that, if you did turn away, you would cause corruption in the earth and
sever your ties of kinship? Such are the people Allah has cursed making
them deaf and blinding their eyes.'</i> (W47:23-24; 47:22-23)" [Agreed
upon]
<p>316. Abu Hurayra said, "A man came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, and asked, 'Messenger of Allah, what
person is the most entitled to the best of my company?' He replied, 'Your
mother.' He said, 'Then whom?' He replied, 'Your mother.' He said, 'Then
whom?' He replied, 'Your mother. He said, 'Then whom?' He answered, 'Your
father.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>In one variant, "'O Messenger of Allah, who is the most entitled to
good companionship?' He replied, 'Your mother, then your mother, then your
mother, then your father, then the nearest relative and the next nearest.'"
<p>317. Abu Hurayra said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, 'May his nose be in the dust! Then may his nose be in the
dust! Then may his nose be in the dust &shy; someone whose parents are
old, or one of them is old, and he does not enter the Garden!'" [Muslim]
<p>318. Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported that a man said,
"Messenger of Allah, I have some relatives with whom I maintain relations
but they cut me off. I am good to them and they are bad to me. I am forbearing
to them and they are impatient towards me." He said, "If you are as you
have said, then it is as if you are giving them hot embers to drink. You
will continue to have a helper from Allah against them as long as you remain
doing that." [Muslim]
<p>319. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Anyone who desires the expansion of his provision
or to have the best of his life prolonged, should maintain ties of kinship.'"
[Agreed upon]
<p>320. Anas said, "Abu Talha had more property in palm trees than any
of the Ansar in Madina. His favourite property was Bayruha' which was opposite
the mosque. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
used to enter it and drink its sweet water." Anas said, "When this ayat
was sent down: <i>'You will not attain true goodness until you give of
what you love'</i> (W3:91; H3:92) Abu Talha went to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah,
Allah, Almighty says, <i>"You will not attain true goodness until you give
of what you love."</i> The property I love the best is Bayruha'. It is
<i>sadaqa</i> for Allah whose goodness I hope for and I hope that it will
be stored up for me with Allah Almighty. Messenger of Allah, dispose of
it in whatever way Allah shows you is best.' The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Excellent! That is a profitable
property. That is is a profitable property. I have heard what you have
said and I think that you should give it to your relatives.' Abu Talha
said, 'I will do that, Messenger of Allah!' So Abu Talha divided it among
his relatives and cousins." [Agreed upon]
<p>321. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As said, "A man came to the Prophet
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Shall I give
you my oath of allegiance based on emigration and jihad, seeking a reward
from Allah Almighty?' He asked, 'Are either of your parents living?' He
replied, 'Yes, both of them.' He said, 'Do you desire a reward from Allah
Almighty?' He replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'Go back to your parents and keep
good company with them.'" [Agreed upon. This is the version of Muslim]
<p>In one of their variants, "A man came and asked permission to go on
jihad. He said, 'Are your parents alive?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'So
expend your effort on them.'"
<p>322. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported: "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, 'A person who maintains ties of kinship is not
someone who only does so with those who maintain ties with him. A person
who maintains ties of kinship is someone who restores them when they have
been cut off.'" [al-Bukhari]
<p>323. 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, 'Kinship is suspended from the Throne and says,
"Allah will connect with all who maintain my ties. Allah will sever his
connection with all who sever them.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>324. Umm al-Mu'minin Maymuna bint al-Harith reported that she set a
slave-girl free without asking the permission of the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace. On her day when he came around to her, she
said, "Are you aware, Messenger of Allah, that I have freed my slavegirl?"
He said, "Did you do so?" She said, "Yes.' He said, "If you had given her
to your maternal uncles, you would have had a greater reward." [Agreed
upon]
<p>325. Asma' bint Abi Bakr as-Siddiq said, "My mother came to me during
the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
while she was still an idolater and I asked the Messenger of Allah, 'My
mother has come to me, wanting something. Shall I give it to her?' He said,
'Yes. Give to your mother.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>326. Zaynab ath-Thaqafiyya, the wife of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Give
alms, O congregation of women, even from your jewellery.'" She said, "I
went back to 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud and said to him, 'You are a man of little
wealth and the Messenger of Allah has commanded us to give sadaqa. So go
to him and ask him if [my supporting you] will be enough for me. If not,
I will pay it to someone other than you.' He said, 'Rather you should go
to him yourself.' So I went and there was one of the women of the Ansar
at the door of the Messenger of Allah may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, whose situation was similar to mine. The Messenger of Allah inspired
awe and Bilal came out to us, so we said to him, 'Go to the Messenger of
Allah may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and tell him that there
are two women at the door who are asking him whether sadaqa to their husbands
and the orphans in their care will be enough for them. Do not tell him
who we are.' So Bilal went in to the Messenger of Allah and asked him.
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'Who are they?' He said, 'A woman of the Ansar and Zaynab.' The Messenger
of Allah asked, 'Which Zaynab is it?' He said, 'The wife of 'Abdullah."
He said, 'They will both have two rewards: the reward of kinship and the
reward of sadaqa.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>327. Abu Sufyan Sakhr ibn Harb said in a long hadith concerning what
happened with Heraclius is that he said, "Heraclius asked, 'What does he
order you to do?' meaning the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace." He said, "I said, 'He says, "Worship Allah alone and do not associate
anything with Him and abandon what our ancestors said." He commands us
to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste, and to maintain ties of kinship.'"
[Agreed upon]
<p>328. Abu Dharr reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "You will conquer a land in which the <i>qirat</i>
will be mentioned."
<p>In one variant, "You will conquer Egypt which is a land in which the
<i>qirat</i>
is used, so command its people to good. They have right to security and
ties of kinship."
<p>In one variant, "When you conquer it, be good to its people. They have
right to security and ties of kinship," or he said, "right to security
and ties of marriage."
<p>The scholars say, "The ties of kinship come from the fact that Hajar,
the mother of Isma'il, was one of them, and the ties of marriage come from
the fact that Maria the mother of Ibrahim, the son of the Messenger of
Allah, , may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was one of them."
<p>329. Abu Hurayra said, "When this verse was sent down, <i>'Warn your
near relatives,' </i>(26:214), the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, summoned Quraysh and they gathered, both the common
people and the elite. He said, 'O Banu 'Abdu Shams! O Banu Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy!
Save yourselves from the Fire! O Banu Murra ibn Ka'b! Save yourselves from
the Fire! O Banu 'Abdu Manaf! Save yourselves from the Fire! O Banu Hashim!
Save yourselves from the Fire! O Banu 'Abdu'l-Muttalib! Save yourselves
from the Fire! O Fatima! Save yourself from the Fire! I do not possess
anything to help you against Allah other than the fact of your kinship
which I will maintain." [Muslim]
<p>330. Abu 'Abdullah 'Amr ibn al-'As said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, speaking openly and not in secret,
and he said, 'The people of the Banu so-and-so are not my friends. My friends
are Allah and the righteous believers, but they have kinship with me which
I keep up." [Agreed upon. This is the version in al-Bukhari.]
<p>331. Abu Ayyub Khalid ibn Zayd al-Ansari reported that a man said, "Messenger
of Allah, tell me about an action that will bring me into the Garden and
keep me far from the Fire?" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him,
perform the prayer and pay the zakat and maintain ties of kinship." [Agreed
upon]
<p>332. Salman ibn 'Amir reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "When one of you breaks the fast, he should
break it with dates. They are a blessing. If he cannot find any dates,
then water. It is pure." He said, "<i>Sadaqa</i> given to a poor person
is sadaqa but to a relative it is both <i>sadaqa</i> and maintaining ties
of kinship." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>333. Ibn 'Umar said, "I had a wife whom I loved but whom 'Umar disliked.
He said to me, 'Divorce her,' and I refused. 'Umar went to the Prophet
and mentioned that to him and the Prophet said, 'Divorce her.'" [Abu Dawud]
<p>334. Abu'd-Darda' reported that a man came to him and said, "I have
a wife whom my mother has told me to divorce." He said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Your parents are
the main door of the Garden. If you wish, you can remove that door or preserve
it.'" [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>335. Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "A maternal aunt has the same status as a mother."
[at-Tirmidhi]
<p>There are many famous hadiths regarding this in the Sound Collections.

On the prohibition of disobeying parents and severing ties of kinship</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>Allah Almighty says, <i>"Is it not likely that, if you did
turn away, you would cause corruption in the earth and sever your ties
of kinship? Such are the people Allah has cursed making them deaf and blinding
their eyes."</i> (W47:23-24; 47:22-23) The Almighty says, <i>"But as for
those who break Allah's contract after it has been agreed and sever what
Allah has commanded to be joined, and cause corruption in the earth, the
curse will be upon them. They will have the Evil Abode."</i> (W13:26; H13:25)
and the Almighty says, <i>"Your Lord has decreed: that you should worship
none but Him, and that you should show kindness to your parents, whether
one or both of them reach old age with you. So do not say 'Ugh!' to them
out of irritation and do not be harsh with them but speak to them with

and say: 'Lord, show mercy to them as they did in looking after me when
I was small.'" </i>(17:23-24)</blockquote>
336. Abu Bakr Nufay' ibn al-Harith said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Shall I inform you about the greatest
of the major sins?' three times. We said, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He
said, 'Associating others with Allah and disobedience to your parents.'
He was reclining and sat up and said, 'And telling lies and giving false
testimony.' He kept repeating them until we said, 'If only he would be
quiet.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>337. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As reported that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The major sins are associating others
with Allah, disobeying your parents, killing someone and giving a false
oath." [al-Bukhari]
<p>338. Abu 'Abdullah 'Amr ibn al-'As reported that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "One of the major wrong
actions is for a man to abuse his parents." They asked, "O Messenger of
Allah, is it possible for a man to abuse his parents?" He replied, "Yes.
He may curse a another man's father who in turn curses his father, and
curse his mother and he in turn curses his mother." [Agreed upon]
<p>In one variant, "One of the worst major wrong actions is for a man to
curse his parents." It was said, "O Messenger of Allah, how can a man curse
his parents?" He said, "He may curse another man's father who in turn curses
his father, and curse his mother and he in turn curses his mother."
<p>339. Abu Muhammad Jubayr ibn Mut'im reported that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Someone who severs (ties
of kinship) will not enter the Garden." [Agreed upon]
<p>Sufyan said in his variant, "Someone who severs ties of kinship..."
<p>340. Abu 'Isa al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba reported that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty has forbidden you
to disobey your mothers, to deny others what is rightfully theirs or demand
what is not rightfully yours, and to bury your daughters alive and He dislikes
you engaging in chit-chat, asking too many questions and wasting money."
[Agreed upon]

The excellence of dutifulness shown to the friends of one's father and
mother, relatives, wife, and others whom one should honour</font></font></b></center>

<p>341. Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "The highest dutifulness is that a man should give to
those his father likes."
<p>342. 'Abdullah ibn Dinar reported about 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar is that
one of the desert Arabs met him on the road to Makka and 'Abdullah ibn
'Umar greeted him and mounted him on a donkey which he used to ride and
gave him a turban which he was wearing. Ibn Dinar said, "We said to him,
'May Allah put you right! They are desert Arabs and they are content with
little!' 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar said, 'This one's father had love for 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab and I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, "The most devout form of devotion is to establish
relations with a man who loved one's father?"'"
<p>In one variant from Ibn Dinar from Ibn 'Umar is that when he went out
to Makka, he had a donkey on which he would rest when he was weary of riding
his camel and his turban was wrapped round his head. When he was on that
donkey one day, he passed by a desert Arab and said, "Are you not the son
of so-and-so son of so-and-so?" He said, "Yes indeed." So he gave him the
donkey and said, "Ride this," and he gave him the turban and said. "Wrap
this round your head." One of his companions said to him, "May Allah forgive
you! You gave this desert Arab a donkey which you were resting on and a
turban which you had wrapped around your head?" He said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The most devout
form of devotion is to establish relations with a man who loved one's father
after his death.' His father was a friend of 'Umar." [Muslim]
<p>343. Abu Usayd Malik ibn Rabi'a as-Sa'idi said, "Once while we were
sitting with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, a man from the Banu Salama came up and asked, 'O Messenger of Allah,
is there any devotion to my parents which I can show them after their death?'
He said, 'Yes, praying for them, asking forgiveness for them, fulfilling
their pledges after them, maintaining ties with relations which are only
maintained through them, and honouring any friend of theirs." [Abu Dawud]
<p>344. 'A'isha said, "I was never jealous towards any of the other wives
of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as I was jealous
towards Khadija even though I never saw her. However, he used to mention
her often. Often when he sacrificed a sheep, he would cut it into pieces
and send them to Khadija's friends. I would often say to him, 'It is as
if there was only Khadija in the world!' He would say, 'She was as she
was and I had children from her.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>In one variant, "If he sacrificed a sheep, he would give enough of it
to her friends to suffice them."
<p>In one variant, "When he sacrificed a sheep, he would say, 'Send it
to the friends of Khadija.'"
<p>In one variant she said, "Hala bint Khuwaylid, the sister of Khadija,
asked permission to come into the Messenger of Allah, and it reminded him
of how Khadija had used to ask permission, and that made him very happy
so that he said, 'O Allah, Hala bint Khuwalid!'"
<p>345. Anas ibn Malik said, "I went out with Jarir ibn 'Abdullah al-Bajali
on a journey and he tried to serve me so I said to him, 'Do not do that.'
He said, 'I saw the Ansar do something for the Messenger of Allah and I
promised myself that I would not keep the company of any of them without
serving him.'" [Agreed upon]

Honouring the people of the family of the Messenger of Allah and their

<blockquote>Allah Almighty said,<i> "Allah wishes to remove all impurity
from you, People of the House, and to purify you completely," </i>(33:33)
and the Almighty said<i>, "As for those who honour Allah's sacred rites,
that (honour) comes from the taqwa in their hearts."</i> (W22:30; H22:32)</blockquote>
346. Yazid ibn Hayyan said, "Husayn ibn Sabura, 'Amr ibn Muslim and I went
to Zayd ibn Arqam . When we were sitting with him, Husayn said to him,
'Zayd, you have received much good. You saw the Messenger of Allah, heard
his words, raided with him and prayed behind him. You have received much
good, Zayd. Zayd, tell us something you heard from the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, 'Nephew, I have reached
old age and have become old. I have forgotten some of what I used to remember
from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. So
accept what I relate to you and do not press me for what I do not.' Then
he said, 'The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
stood up among us one day to address us at a watering-place called Khumma
between Makka and Madina. He praised and glorified Allah, admonished and
reminded people and then said, "O people! I am a mortal and the messenger
of my Lord will soon come to me and I will respond. I leave you two great
things. The first is the Book of Allah which contains guidance and light.
So take the Book of Allah and cling firmly to it." He promoted the Book
of Allah and stimulated our desire for it. Then he said, "And the people
of my house. I remind you of Allah with respect to the people of my house.
I remind you of Allah with respect to the people of my house."' Husayn
said to him, 'Who are the people of his house, Zayd? Are not his wives
the people of his house?' He said, 'His wives are among the people of his
house, but the people of his house are those who were forbidden to take
sadaqa after him.' He said, 'Who are they?' He said, 'They are the family
of 'Ali, the family of 'Aqil, the family of Ja'far and the family of 'Abbas.'
He said, 'All of these were forbidden sadaqa?' He said, 'Yes.'" [Muslim]
<p>In one variant, "I leave among you two great things. One of them is
the Book of Allah and it is the rope of Allah. All who follow it are guided.
All who abandon it are misguided."
<p>347. Ibn 'Umar reported that Abu Bakr as-Siddiq said, "Respect Muhammad,

<blockquote>Allah Almighty said, <i>"Are they the same &shy; those who

348. Abu Mas'ud 'Uqba ibn 'Amr al-Badri al-Ansari said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The people should
take as Imam the one among them who knows the most of the Book of Allah.
If they are equal in respect of recitation, then the one among them who
has the most knowledge of the Sunna. If they are equal in respect of the
Sunna, the one who made hijra earlier. If they they are equal in respect
of hijra, then the oldest of them in respect of age. A man should not lead
a man in the prayer in his own house nor sit in his house in his special
place without his permission.'" [Muslim]
<p>In one variant of his, "The oldest of them in respect of Islam" instead
of "age".
<p>In one variant, "The people should take as Imam the one of them who
knows the most of the Book of Allah and the most experienced of them in
respect of recitation. If their recitation is the same, then the oldest
of them in respect of emigration. If they are equal in respect of emigration,
then the oldest in respect of age should lead them in the prayer."
<p>349. Abu Mas'ud 'Uqba ibn 'Amr al-Badari al-Ansari said, "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to touch our shoulders
in the prayer and say, 'Stand in line and do not be uneven causing your
hearts to differ. The nearest of you to me should be those who have reached
maturity and have intelligence, and then those who are next to them." [Muslim]
<p>350. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "The nearest of you to me should
be those who have reached maturity and have intelligence, and then those
who are next to them," three times. "Beware of the turmoil of the markets."
[Muslim]
<p>351. Abu Yahya, and it is said Abu Muhammad, Sahl ibn Hathma al-Ansari
said, "'Abdullah ibn Sahl and Muhayyisa ibn Mas'ud went to Khaybar at a
time when there was a truce. They parted and then Muhayyisa came upon 'Abdullah
ibn Sahl, murdered and covered in blood. He buried him and then went to
Madina. Then 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Sahl, and Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa, the
sons of Mas'ud, went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, and 'Abdu'r-Rahman began to speak. He said, 'The eldest, the eldest.'
for he was the youngest of the people there. So he was silent, and the
two of them spoke. He said, 'Do you swear (to this) and demand your right
from the murderer?'" and he completed the hadith. [Agreed upon]
<p>352. Jabir said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
put together in one grave two men among those who were killed at Uhud and
said, 'Which of them knew more Qur'an?' When one of them was pointed out,
he put him in the grave first." [al-Bukhari]
<p>353. Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "I was shown in a dream that I was using a siwak when
two men came to me. One of them was older than the other. I handed the
siwak to the younger and was told, 'To the elder.' So I gave it to the
elder of the two." [Muslim]
<p>354. Abu Musa said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "Part of showing respect for the majesty of Allah
Almighty is to honour Muslims with white hair and those who know the Qur'an
by heart without either being excessive in respect of it or abandoning
it, and to honour a just Sultan." [Abu Dawud]
<p>355. 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb's grandfather said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Anyone who does not show mercy
to our young people nor honour our old people is not one of us." [Abu Dawud
and at-Tirmidhi]
<p>In the variant of Abu Dawud, "...respect the rights of our old."
<p>356. Maymun ibn Abi Shabib reported that one day a beggar passed by
'A'isha and she gave him a piece of bread, and then a man wearing a fine
garment appeared and passed by her and she asked him to sit and he ate.
She was asked about that and said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'Give people their proper place." [Abu Dawud]
<p>Muslim mentioned it at the beginning of his Sahih without any isnad,
and said that it is mentioned that 'A'isha said, "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded us to give people their
proper place."
<p>357. Ibn 'Abbas said, "'Uyayna ibn Hisn came and stayed with al-Hurr
ibn Qays, who was one of the group whom 'Umar brought near to him. The
reciters were the people of the assembly and council of 'Umar, no matter
whether they were mature men or young men. 'Uyayna said to his nephew,
'Nephew, you have access to this amir, so ask him for permission for me
to see him.' He asked permission and 'Umar gave permission. When he entered,
he said, 'O Ibn al-Khattab! By Allah, it is that you do not give enough
to us and you do not judge justly between us.' 'Umar was so angry that
he wanted to punish him. Al-Hurr said to him, 'Amir al-Mu'minin, Allah
Almighty said to His Prophet,
<i>"Make allowances for people, command what
is right, and turn away from the ignorant."</i> (7:199) This is one of
the ignorant.' By Allah, 'Umar did not do less than that when he recited
it. He acted in accordance with the Book of Allah Almighty." [al-Bukhari]
<p>358. Abu Sa'id Samura ibn Jundub said, "I was a boy in the time of the

The spirits are gathered in ranks like troops. Those which knew one another
are in harmony. Those which did not know one another are discordant." [Muslim]
<p>Al-Bukhari related the words, "The spirits..." etc is from the transmission
of 'A'isha.
<p>372. Usayr ibn 'Amr, who is called Ibn Jabir, said, "When the reinforcements
of the people of the Yemen came to him, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab asked them,
'Is Uways ibn 'Amir among you?' until he reached Uways. He said to him,
'Are you Uways ibn 'Amir?' 'Yes,' he replied. He said, 'From Murad and
then from Qaran?" He replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'You had leprosy and were
cured of it except for a spot the size of a dirham?' He said, 'Yes.' He
asked, 'You have a mother?' He said, 'Yes.' He said, 'I heard the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Uways ibn 'Amir
will come to you with the reinforcements of the people of Yemen from Murad
and then from Qaran. He will have had leprosy and have been cured of it
except for a the spot the size of a dirham and he has a mother to whom
he is devoted. If he were to take an oath by Allah, Allah would fulfill
it. If you are able to ask him to ask forgiveness for you, do so." So ask
forgiveness for me.' He asked forgiveness for him. 'Umar said to him, 'Where
are you going?' He said, 'Kufa.' He said, 'Shall I write a letter for you
to its governor?' He said, 'I prefer to be among the dusty people.' When
the following year came, one of their nobles made hajj and came to 'Umar,
who asked him about Uways. He said, 'I left him in a shabby house with
few possesions.' He said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, "Uways ibn 'Amir will come to you with the
reinforcements of the people of Yemen from Murad and then from Qaran. He
will have had leprosy and have been cured of it except for a spot the size
of a dirham and he has a mother to whom he is devoted. If he were to take
an oath by Allah, Allah would fulfill it. If you are able to ask him to
ask forgiveness for you, do so."' He went to Uways and said, 'Ask forgiveness
for me.' He said, 'You have just come from a righteous journey, so ask
forgiveness for me.' He said, 'You met 'Umar?' He said, 'Yes,' and he asked
forgiveness for him. The people became aware of him and so he left." [Muslim]
<p>In a variant of Muslim also from Usayr ibn Jabir is that the people
of Kufa came to 'Umar and they included a man whose name was Uways. 'Umar
said, "Is there here anyone from Qaran?" That man came and 'Umar said,
"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said,
'A man will come to you from Yemen called Uways who has no one left in
the Yemen but his mother. He had white leprosy and prayed to Allah Almighty
and He removed it except for a spot the size of a dinar or a dirham. If
any of you meet him, you should ask him to ask forgiveness for you.'"
<p>In another variant of his is that 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger
of Allah say, 'The best of the Tabi'un is a man called Uways who has a
mother and who has had leprosy. So go to him and let him ask forgiveness
for you.'"
<p>373. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "I asked the Prophet's permission to
make<i> 'umra</i> and he gave me permission and said, 'My brother, do not
forget us in your supplication.' He spoke a word which I would not be happy
to exchange for the whole of this world."
<p>In one variant, he said, "Give us a share in your supplication, my brother."
[Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi]
<p>374. Ibn 'Umar said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, used to go to Quba, both riding and walking, and would pray two

Quba both riding and walking, and Ibn 'Umar used to do that as well."

there was a young man with white teeth there with some other people. When
they disagreed about something, they referred it to him and followed his
opinion. I inquired about him and it was said, 'That is Mu'adh ibn Jabal.'
The following day, I went early and I found that he had come earlier than
me and I found him praying. I waited for him until he finished his prayer
and then I approached him from the front. I greeted him and then said,
'By Allah, I love you for the sake of Allah.' He said, 'By Allah?' I said,
'By Allah.' He said, 'By Allah?' I said, 'By Allah.' He took hold of the
upper part of my cloak and pulled me to him. He said, 'Rejoice! I heard

is certainly a Sign in that for anyone who fears the punishment of the
Next World. That is a Day to which mankind will all be gathered. That is

Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into you and is encharged

actions, and whether you will be wretched or happy. By Him, apart from
Whom there is no god, one of you can do the actions of someone destined
for the Garden until there is only an armspan between him and it, and then
what is written will overtake him and he will do the actions of someone
destined for the Fire and enter it. And one of you can do the actions of

one with the least punishment.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>399. Samura ibn Jundub reported that the Prophet of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "The Fire will engulf some of them
up to the ankles, and some of them up to the knees, and some of them up
to the waist and some of them up to the neck." [Muslim]
<p>400. Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "People will stand before the Lord of the worlds until
some of them are immersed in sweat up to the middle of their ears." [Agreed
upon]

him peace, addressed us in a speech the like of which I have never heard.
He said, 'If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.'
The Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, covered their faces and sobbed." [Agreed upon]
<p>In one variant, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, heard something about his Companions and he addressed them,
saying, "The Garden and the Fire were shown to me, and I have never seen
the like of this day in respect of good and evil. If you knew what I know,
you would laugh little and weep much.' A harder day did not come upon the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah than that and they covered their faces
and sobbed."
<p>402. Al-Miqdad said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'On the Day of Rising, the sun will draw
near creatures until it is something like a mile from them. (Sulaym ibn
'Amir ar-Rawi said from al-Miqdad, "By Allah, I do not know what he meant
by a mile, whether it is the distance on the earth or the mile which the
eye imagines?") People will be immersed in sweat according to their actions.
It will be up to the ankles of some of them, and up to the knees of some
of them, and up to the waists of some of them, and sweat will completely
muzzle some of them,' and the Messenger of Allah, , may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, pointed with his hand to his mouth." [Muslim]
<p>403. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising people will sweat
until their sweat sinks seventy cubits into the earth and then it will
muzzle them by reaching up to their ears." [Agreed upon]
<p>404. Abu Hurayra said, "We were with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, when he heard something fall. He said, 'Do
you know what it was?' We said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He
said, 'It was a stone which was thrown into the Fire seventy years ago
and it has been falling in the Fire until now when it reached the bottom
and you heard it fall.'" [Muslim]
<p>405. 'Adi ibn Hatim reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "There is none of you but that his
Lord will speak to him without any interpreter between Himself and him.
You will look to your right and only see what you sent forward and you
will look to your left and only see what you sent forward. You will look
in front of you and only see the Fire facing you. So shield yourselves
from the Fire, even if only with half a date." [Agreed upon]
<p>406. Abu Dharr reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "I see what you do not see and I hear what
you do not hear. Heaven moans and it has the right to moan. There is no
place in it the width of four fingers without an angel placing his brow
on it, prostrating to Allah Almighty. By Allah, if you knew what I know,
you would laugh little and weep much and you would not enjoy women on beds
and you would go out to the streets seeking the help of Allah Almighty."
[at-Tirmidhi]
<p>407. Abu Barza Nadla ibn 'Ubayd al-Aslami reported that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "A slave will
remain standing until he is asked about his life and how he spent it, his
knowledge and how he acted regarding it, his property and how he acquired
it and spent it, and his body and how he wore it out." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>408. Abu Hurayra said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, recited,<i> 'On that Day it will impart all its news.'
</i>(99:4) Then he said, 'Do you know what its news is?' They said, 'Allah
and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'Its news is that it will testify
against every slave of Allah, man or woman, regarding what he (or she)
did on its back. It will say, "You did such-and-such and such-and-such
on such-and-such a day?" That is its news.'" [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>409. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said. "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, 'How can there be enjoyment when the one
with the trumpet has placed the trumpet to his mouth with his ear listening
for the moment when is commanded to blow and then he will blow?.' It seemed
as if that was hard for the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and so he said to them 'Say, "Allah is enough
for us and the best guardian."'" [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>410. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Those who have fear, set off at the beginning
of the night, and those who who set off at the beginning of the night reach
the resting-place. The trading goods of Allah have a high price. The trading
goods of Allah are the Garden." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>411. 'A'isha said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'People will be gathered on the Day of Rising
naked, barefoot, and uncircumcised.' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, men
and women together, looking at one another?' He said, 'O 'A'isha, the business
will be too terrible for them to be concerned with that.'"
<p>In one variant, "The business will be too important for them to look
at one another." [Agreed upon]

god but Allah alone with no partner and that Muhammad is His slave and
Messenger and that 'Isa is the slave of Allah and His Messenger and a word

<p>413. Abu Dharr reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Allah the Mighty and Exalted, says, 'Anyone who comes
with a good action will have ten like it or more. If anyone comes with
a wrong action, the repayment of a wrong action is a wrong action like
it or I will forgive him. If anyone approaches Me by a hand-span, I come
to him an arm-span. If anyone approaches Me by an arm-span, I come to him
two arm spans. If anyone approaches Me walking, I come to him running.
If anyone meets Me with mistakes equivalent in weight to the whole earth,
having not associated anything with Me, I will meet him with the same amount
of forgiveness." [Muslim]
<p>414. Jabir said, "A bedouin came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah, what things are obligatory?'
He said, 'Anyone who dies without associating anything with Allah will
enter the Garden and anyone who dies associating something else with Him
will enter the Fire.'" [Muslim]
<p>415. Anas said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
was riding with Mu'adh behind him. He said, 'Mu'adh!' He replied, 'At your
service, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Mu'adh!' He replied, 'At your service,
Messenger of Allah' three times. Then the Prophet said, 'There is no one
who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger
of Allah, sincerely from his heart, without Allah making it unlawful for
the Fire to touch him.' Mu'adh said, 'Messenger of Allah, shall I tell
the people that so that they can rejoice?' He said, 'Then they will rely
on it.' Mu'adh related it when he was dying, fearing to commit a wrong
action [by concealing the knowledge]." [Agreed upon]
<p>416. Abu Hurayra or Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (the transmitter is unsure,
but doubt does not detract from the specific Companion since they are all
completely sound) said, "On the Tabuk expedition, the people were suffering
from hunger and said, 'Messenger of Allah. if you were to permit us to
do it, we would slaughter our camels and eat them and use their fat.' The
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Do
it.' 'Umar came and said, 'Messenger of Allah, if you do this, there will
be few backs to carry us. Rather ask them to bring what is left of their
provisions and then pray to Allah over them for blessing for them. Perhaps
Allah will put blessing into them.' The Messenger of Allah said, 'Yes.'
He called for a leather mat and spread it out and then he called for their
left-over provisions. One man would bring a handful of millet and another
would bring a handful of dates and another would bring a piece of bread
until a few things like that were gathered on the mat. Then the Messenger
of Allah made supplication for blessing and said, 'Put it in your containers.'
They put it in their containers until every container in the army was full.
They ate until they were satisfied and there was still some left over.
The Messenger of Allah said, 'I testify that there is no god but Allah
and that I am the Messenger of Allah. No slave who meets Allah with these
two, without doubting them, will be veiled from the Garden.'" [Muslim]
<p>417. 'Itban ibn Malik, one of those who were present at Badr, said,
"I used to lead my people, the Banu Salim, in the prayer, but when the
rains came, a river used to come between me and them. It was hard for me
to cross to their mosque, so I went to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, and said to him, 'My eyesight is weak and
when it rains, the water flows in the river bed between me and my people
so that it is hard for me to cross it. I would very much like you to come
and pray in my house so that I can make it a prayer-place." The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him "I will
do that.' The following day when the sun was well up, the Messenger of
Allah and Abu Bakr came and the Messenger of Allah asked for permission
to enter and I gave him permission. He did not sit down but said, "Where
in your house would you like me to pray?" I indicated to him the place
where I liked to prayer. The Messenger of Allah stood and said the takbir,
and we formed rows behind him. He prayed two
<i>rak'ats </i>and then said
the taslim. We said the <i>taslim</i> when he said it. I persuaded him
to eat a dish of <i>khazira</i> which had been prepared for him. Quite
a number of men from our clan had gathered in the house and one man said,
'What has happened to Malik? I do not see him.' Another man said, 'That
man is a hypocrite who does not love Allah and His Messenger.' The Messenger
of Allah said, 'Do not say that. Do you not see that he has said, "There
is no god but Allah," desiring by that only the face of Allah?' The man
said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best. By Allah, we have only seen that
his love and speech is for the hypocrites.' The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Allah has forbidden the Fire
for anyone who says "There is no god but Allah" desiring by that the face
of Allah.'" [Agreed upon]
<p><i>Khazira</i> is flour cooked with fat.
<p>418. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, was brought some captives and there was a woman
among them who was running about. When she found a child among the captives,
she took it and brought it close to her and suckled it. The Messenger of
Allah said, 'Can you imagine this woman casting her child into the Fire?'
We said, 'No, by Allah.' He said, 'Allah is more merciful to His slaves
than this woman is to her child.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>419. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "When Allah created creation, He wrote in
a book which is with Him above the Throne, 'My mercy predominates over
My anger.'"
<p>In one variant, "Predominated over My anger," and in one variant, "preceded
My anger." [Agreed upon]
<p>420. Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah say, 'Allah divided
mercy into a hundred parts and He kept back ninety-nine parts with Himself
and left one part on the earth. It is from this part that creatures show
mercy to one another so that an animal lifts its hoof from its young fearing
to hurt them.'"
<p>In one variant, "Allah Almighty has a hundred mercies out of which He
sent down one mercy among jinn, men, beasts and insects by which they show
affection to one another and by which they show mercy to one another and
by which wild animals show mercy to their young. Allah Almighty has held
back ninety-nine of the mercies and will show them to His slaves on the
Day of Rising." [Agreed upon]
<p>Muslim also related it from Salman al-Farisi who said that the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Allah Almighty
has a hundred mercies. One of them is the mercy by which creatures show
mercy to one another, and ninety-nine are for the Day of Rising."
<p>In one variant, "On the day He created the heavens and the earth, Allah
Almighty created a hundred mercies, each mercy equal to what is between
the heaven and the earth, and He put one mercy on the earth by which a
mother has compassion for her child and wild animals and birds for each
other. On the Day of Rising, He will perfect them with this mercy.
<p>421. Abu Hurayra reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, in what he relates from his Lord, Blessed and Exalted,
who said, "A slave did a wrong action and said, 'O Allah, forgive me my
wrong action!' Allah, Blessed and Exalted, said, 'My slave committed a
wrong action and then acknowledged that he had a Lord who forgives wrong
action and punishes wrong action.' The slave again committed a wrong action
and said, 'O Lord, forgive me my wrong action.' Allah, Blessed and Exalted,
said, 'My slave committed a wrong action and then acknowledged that he
had a Lord who forgives wrong action and punishes wrong action.' The slave
again committed a wrong action and said, 'O Lord, forgive me my wrong action.'
Allah, Blessed and Exalted, said, 'My slave committed a wrong action and
then acknowledged that he had a Lord who forgives wrong action and punishes
wrong action. I have forgiven My slave so let him do what he likes.'" [Agreed
upon]
<p>"Let him do what he likes" means as long as he does this. He commits
a wrong action and repents and I forgive him. Repentance wipes out what
is before it."
<p>422. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "By the One in whose hand my life is, if
you had not sinned, Allah would have removed you and brought other people
who did commit wrong actions and asked for the forgiveness of Allah Almighty
so that He could forgive them." [Muslim]
<p>423. Abu Ayyub Khalid ibn Zayd said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'If you had not sinned, Allah
would have created other creatures who did sin and ask forgiveness so He
could forgive them.'" [Muslim]
<p>424. Abu Hurayra said, "We were sitting waiting for the Messenger of
Allah, and Abu Bakr and 'Umar and some others were with us. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, got up from among us
and then was slow in returning to us and we were afraid that something
had happened to him while he was not with us. We were alarmed and got up.
I was the first to be alarmed and I went out to look for the Messenger
of Allah and I came upon him in a garden belonging to the Ansar" &shy;
and he mentioned the hadith in its entirety until he said &shy; "The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Go and give the
good news of the Garden to whoever you meet in front of this garden who
testifies that "There is no god but Allah", his heart being certain of
it.'" [Muslim]
<p>425. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As reported that the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, recited the words of Allah, the Mighty and
Exalted, about Ibrahim, peace be upon him,<i> "My Lord! They have misguided
many of mankind. If anyone follows me, he is with me" </i>(W14:38; H14:37)
and the words of 'Isa, peace be upon him<i>, "If You punish them, they
are Your slaves. If You forgive them, You are the Almighty, the All-Wise."</i>
(W5:120; H5:119) Then he raised his hands and said, "O Allah! My community!
My community!" and he wept. Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, said, "Jibril!
Go to Muhammad, and your Lord knows best, and ask him what is making him
weep." Jibril came to him and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, told him what he had said, and Allah knew it best.
Allah Almighty said, "Jibril, Go to Muhammad and say, 'We will make you
happy in respect of your community and we will not make you sad.'" [Muslim]
<p>426. Mu'adh ibn Jabal said, "I was riding behind the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a donkey. He asked, 'Mu'adh,
do you know what is Allah's right on His slaves and the right of the slaves
on Allah?' I replied, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He said, 'Allah's
right on His slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything
with Him. The slaves' right on Allah is that He will not punish anyone
who does not associate anything with Him.' I said, 'Messenger of Allah,
shall I tell the people that so that they can rejoice?' He said, 'Then
they will rely on it.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>427. Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, aid, "When a Muslim is questioned in the grave, he
should testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the
Messenger of Allah. That is by the words of the Almighty, <i>'Allah makes
those who believe, firm with the Firm Word in the life of this world and
in the Hereafter.'"</i> (W14:29; H14:28). [Agreed upon]
<p>428. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "When an unbeliever does a good deed, he enjoys
its fruits in this world. In the case of a believer, Allah Almighty will
store up his good deeds for him in the Next world and will also reward
him with provision in this world because of his obedience."
<p>In one variant, "Allah will not wrong a believer in respect of any good
deed - he gives to him on account it in this world and he rewards him for
it in the Next world. The unbeliever enjoys all the fruits of any good
deeds he does for Allah Almighty in this world so that when he passes to
the Next world, he had no good deeds left for which to be repaid." [Muslim]
<p>429. Jabir reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "The metaphor of the five prayers is that of
an sizeable flowing river at the door of one of you in which he washes
five times every day." [Muslim]
<p>430. Ibn 'Abbas said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'If forty men, who do not associate anything
with Allah, stand at the grave of any Muslim man who dies, He allows them
to intercede on his behalf." [Muslim]
<p>431. Ibn Mas'ud said, "There were about forty of us with the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in a tent and he said,
'Would you be content to be a quarter of the people of the Garden?' We
said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Would you be content to be a third of the people
of the Garden?' We said, 'Yes.' He said, 'By the One who has the soul of
Muhammad in His hand, I hope that you will be half of the people of the
Garden. That is because only a submitting soul enters the Garden, and compared
the people of idolatry, you are only like a white hair on the hide of a
black ox, or like a black hair on the hide of a red ox.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>432. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "On the Day of Rising, Allah will
hand over a Jew or a Christian to every Muslim and say, 'Here is your redemption
from the Fire." [Muslim]
<p>In another variant from him is that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Some of the Muslims will be brought on the
Day of Rising with sins the size of mountains and Allah will forgive them."
<p>433. Ibn 'Umar said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, say, 'On the Day of Rising, a believer will be
brought near his Lord until His mercy descends on him and He will ask him
to acknowledge his sins and say, 'Do you confess to such-and-such a sin?
Do you confess to such-and-such a sin?' He will say, 'Lord, I confess.'
He will say, 'I veiled it for you in the world and I forgive you for it
today,' and he will be given the page of his good actions." [Agreed upon]
<p>434. Ibn Mas'ud reported that a man received a kiss from a woman and
went to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and told
him and then Allah Almighty sent down,<i> "Establish the prayers at each
end of the day and in the first part of the night. Good actions eradicate
bad actions."
</i>(11:114) The man said, "Is this for me, Messenger of
Allah?" He said, "It is for all my community." [Agreed upon]
<p>435. Anas said, "A man came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I have incurred a
<i>hadd</i>-punishment,
so carry it out on me.' It was time for the prayer, so he prayed with the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When the prayer
was finished, he said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I have incurred a hadd-punishment,
so carry out the prescription of Allah on me.' He said, "Were you present
at the prayer with us?" He said, "Yes." He said, "You have been forgiven."
[Agreed upon]
<p>436. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Allah is pleased with the slave who eats some
food and then praises Him for it, or drinks a drink and then praises Him
for it." [Muslim]
<p>437. Abu Musa reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "Allah Almighty will stretch out His hand during the night,
turning towards the one who did wrong during the day, and stretch out His
hand during the day, turning towards the one who did wrong during the night,
until the day the sun rises from the place it set." [Muslim]
<p>438. Abu Najih 'Amr ibn 'Abasa as-Salami said, "In the time of Jahiliyya,
I used to think that people were astray and did not have anything, since
they were worshipping idols. Then I heard of a man in Makka who was saying
certain things. I seated myself on my mount and went to him. It was the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was keeping
out of sight as his people were being insolent to him. I proceeded in a
friendly manner until I managed to visit him in Makka and said to him,
'What are you?' He said, 'I am a Prophet.' I said, 'And what is a Prophet?'
He said, 'Allah has sent me.' I said, 'And what has He sent you with?'
He said, 'He has sent me with the task of maintaining ties of kinship,
breaking idols and to say that Allah should be proclaimed one and that
nothing should be associated with him.' I said, 'Who is with you in this?'
He said, 'A free man and a slave.' At that time, Abu Bakr and Bilal were
with him. I said, 'I will follow you.' He said, 'You will not be able to
do that at this present time. Do you not see my state and the state of
the people? Rather return to your people. When you hear that I have prevailed,
then come to me.'"
<p>He said, "I went to my people, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, went to Madina during the time that I was
with them. I began to ask for news and question people when he reached
Madina until a group of the people of Madina came. I said, 'What has this
man done who has come to Madina?' They said, 'People hasten to him. However
his own people want to kill him, but they are unable to do so.' So I went
to Madina and went into him and said, 'Messenger of Allah, do you recognise
me?' He said, 'Yes, you are the one who met me in Makka.'" He said, "I
said, 'O Messenger of Allah, tell me some of what Allah has told you and
about which I am ignorant. Tell me about the prayer.' He said, 'Pray the
Subh prayer and then refrain from prayer until the sun has risen the height
of a spear-shaft. It rises between the horns of shaytan and it is at that
time that the unbelievers prostrate to it. Then pray, and that prayer is
witnessed and attended, until the spear no longer has a shadow. Then refrain
from prayer. It is at that time that Hellfire is stoked up. When the shade
comes, then pray, and the prayer is witnessed and attended, until you have
prayed the 'Asr prayer. Then refrain from the prayer until the sun sets.
It sets between the horns of shaytan and at that time the unbelievers prostrate
to it.'"
<p>He said, 'I said, 'O Prophet of Allah, tell me about <i>wudu'</i>.'
He said, 'There is no man among you who is brought his wudu' water and
rinses his mouth and sniffs up water and blows it out without the errors
of his face and mouth and nose falling away. Then when he washes his face
as Allah has commanded the errors of his face fall away with the water
from the end of his beard. Then when he washes his hands to the elbows
the errors of his hands fall away from the ends of his fingers with the
water. Then he wipes his head and the errors of his head fall away from
the ends of his hair with the water. Then he washes his feet to the ankles
and the errors of his feet fall away from his toes with the water. If he
stands up and prays and praises Allah Almighty and lauds Him and glorifies
Him in the way that He deserves and devotes his heart to Allah Almighty
and he abandons his error he will be as he was on the day his mother bore
him.'"
<p>'Amr ibn 'Abasa related this hadith to Abu Umama, the Companion of the
Messenger of Allah and Abu Umama said to him, "'Amr ibn 'Abasa! Take care
about saying at one time so much about what a man is given." 'Amr said,
"Abu Umama, I am old and my bones are weak and my end is near and I have
no need to ascribe a lie to Allah Almighty nor to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace. If I had only heard it from the
Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, once, twice,
three times - until he counted seven times - I would never have related
it. But I heard it from him more times than that." [Muslim]
<p>439. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "When Allah Almighty desires mercy for a
nation, he takes its Prophet before it and makes him a predecessor of it
and a forerunner before it, When he wants to destroy a nation, He punishes
them while their Prophet is still alive. He destroys it while he is alive
and looking on and his eye is delighted by its destruction because they
denied him and disobeyed his command." [Muslim]

<p>442. Anas said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, say, 'Allah Almighty says, "O son of Adam! I will
forgive you as long as you call on Me and have hope in Me, no matter what
you do. Son of Adam, I do not care if your wrong actions reach to the clouds
of heaven and then you ask Me for forgiveness, I will forgive you. Son
of Adam, if you were to come with sins equivalent in weight to the whole
earth and then meet Me having not associated anything with Me, I would
come to you with the same amount of forgiveness.'" [at-Tirmidhi]

On combining Fear and Hope</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>Know that what is best for the slave in the state of health
is for him to be fearful and hopeful, and that his fear and hope be equal.
When he is ill, hope is purified. The bases of the Shari'a in the Book
and the Sunna and elsewhere demonstrate that.
<p>Allah Almighty says, <i>"No one feels secure against Allah's devising
except for those who are lost," </i>(W7:98; H7:99) and the Almighty says,
<i>"No one despairs of solace from Allah except for those who are unbelievers."
</i>(12:87) The Almighty says,<i> "On the Day when faces are whitened and
some faces are blackened," </i>(3:106) and the Almighty says<i>, "Your
Lord is swift in retribution, and He is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
</i>(7:167) The Almighty says, <i>"The truly good will be in perfect Bliss,.
The dissolute will be in the Blazing Fire,"</i> (82:13-14) and the Almighty
says<i>, "As for him whose balance is heavy, he will have a most pleasant
life. But as for him whose balance is light, his motherland is Hawiya."
</i>(W101:5-8; H101:6-9) There are many ayats with this meaning and fear
and hope are joined together in two consecutive ayats, several ayats or
one ayat.</blockquote>
443. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "If the believers knew the punishment which
Allah has, none of them would have any hope of attaining His Garden. If
the unbelievers knew the mercy which Allah has, none of them would despair
of reaching His Garden." [Muslim]
<p>444. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "When a body is laid out and the men
carry it on their shoulders, if it was righteous, it says, 'Take me forward,'
and it was it not righteous, it says, 'Woe to me, where are you taking
it?'' Everything except man hears its voice. If he were to hear it, he
would faint." [al-Bukhari]
<p>445. Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "The Garden is nearer to you than your own
sandal strap and it is the same with the Fire." [al-Bukhari]

<p><a NAME="weep"></a><b><font color="#800000"><font size=+1>54. Chapter:
On the Excellence of Weeping</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>Allah Almighty says<i>, "Weeping, they fall on their faces
in prostration, and it increases them in humility," </i>(W17:108; H17:109)
and the Almighty says<i>, "Are then amazed at this discourse and laugh
and do not cry?" </i>(W53;58-59; H53:59-60)</blockquote>
446. Ibn Mas'ud said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said to me, 'Recite the Qur'an to me.' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, shall
I recite to you when it was sent down to you?' He said, 'I want to hear
it from someone other than myself.' So I recited <i>Surat an-Nisa' </i>to
him until I reached this ayat<i>, 'How will it be when We bring a witness
from every nation and bring you as a witness against them?'</i> (4:41)
He said, 'That is enough now,' and I turned to him and his eyes were flowing
with tears." [Agreed upon]
<p>447. Anas said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, addressed us with a speech whose like I have never heard. He
said, 'If you were to know what I know, you would laugh little and weep
much.' The Companions of the Messenger of Allah covered their faces and
sobbed." [Agreed upon]
<p>448. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "No man, who wept out of fear of Allah,
will enter the Fire until the milk returns to the breast. Dust raised in
the way of Allah and the smoke of Jahannam will never be joined together."
[at-Tirmidhi]
<p>449. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "There are seven whom Allah will shade with
His shade on the day when there is no shade but His shade: a just Imam,
a youth who grows up worshipping Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, a man whose
heart is attached to the mosque, two men who love each other for the sake
of Allah, meeting and parting for that reason alone, a man who refuses
the advances of a noble and beautiful woman, saying, 'I fear Allah', a
man who gives sadaqa and conceals it so that his left hand does not know
what his right hand gives, and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone
and his eyes overflow with tears." [Agreed upon]
<p>450. 'Abdullah ibn ash-Shikhkhir said, "I came to the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was praying and his chest
was heaving like a caldron from weeping." [Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi]
<p>451. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said to Ubayy ibn Ka'b, "Allah, the Mighty and Exalted,
has commanded me to recite to you, <i>'Those who reject...</i>' (98)."
He said, "He mentioned me by name?" He said, "Yes," and Ubayy wept. [Agreed
upon]
<p>In one variant, "and Ubayy began to weep."
<p>452. Anas said, "Abu Bakr said to 'Umar after the death of the Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, 'Let us
go to Umm Ayman and visit her as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, used to visit her.' When they reached her, she
wept and they said to her, 'What has made you weep? Do you not know that
what is with Allah Almighty is better for the Messenger of Allah?' She
said, 'I am not weeping because I do not know that what is with Allah is
better for the Messenger of Allah, but I am weeping because the revelation
from heaven has been cut off.' She moved them to tears and they began to
weep with her." [Muslim]
<p>453. Ibn 'Umar said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said to me, was very ill, he was asked about the prayer
and said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.' 'A'isha said, 'Abu
Bakr is a tender-hearted man. When he recites the Qur'an, he is overcome
by weeping.' He said, 'Tell him to lead the prayer.'"
<p>In a variant from 'A'isha, she said, "I said. 'If Abu Bakr stands in
your place, the people will not be able to hear him on account of his weeping.'"
[Agreed upon]
<p>454. Ibrahim ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf reported that 'Abdu'r-Rahman
ibn 'Awf was brought some food while he was fasting and he said, "Mus'ab
ibn 'Umayr was killed and he was a better man than I. He was shrouded in
a cloak. If his head was covered, his feet showed, and if his feet were
covered, his head showed. Worldly goods have been opened up to us," - or
he said, "We have been given what we have been given of this world," -
"and we fear that our good deeds have been given to us in advance." Then
he started to weep to such an extent that he neglected his food. [al-Bukhari]
<p>455. Abu Umama Sudayy ibn 'Ajlan al-Bahili reported that the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to me, said, "There is nothing
which Allah Almighty loves more than two drops and two steps: a drop of
tears shed out of fear of Allah and a drop of blood shed in the way of
Allah. And the two steps are a step in the way of Allah Almighty and a
step towards one of the obligations of Allah Almighty." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>456. The hadith of al-'Irbad ibn Sariya has: "The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave us a profound exhortation
which made our hearts afraid and our eyes weep." [see 157]

On the Excellence of making do with little of this world and the encouragement
to have little of it and the excellence of poverty</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>Allah Almighty says, <i>"The likeness of the life of this world
is that of water which We send down from the sky, which then mingles with
the plants of the earth to provide food for both people and animals. Then,
when the earth is at its loveliest and takes on its fairest guise and its
people think they have it under their control, Our command comes upon it
by night or day and We reduce it to dried-out stubble, as though it had
not been flourishing just the day before! Thus do We make Our Signs plain
for people who reflect." </i>(10:24) The Almighty says,<i> "Describe for
them the likeness of the life of this world. It is like water which We
send down from the sky and the plants of the earth combine with it but
then become dry chaff scattered by the winds. Allah has complete power
over everything. Wealth and sons are the embellishment of the life of this
world. But, in your Lord's sight, right actions which are lasting are better
in reward and a better basis for hope."</i> (W18:44-45; H18:45-46) Allah
Almighty says<i>, "Know that the life of this world is merely a game and
a diversion and decoration and a cause of boasting among yourselves and
trying to outdo one another in wealth and children: like the plant-growth
after rain which delights the cultivators, but then it withers and you
see it turning yellow, and then it becomes broken stubble. In the Next
World there is terrible punishment but also forgiveness from Allah and
His good pleasure. The life of this world is nothing but the enjoyment
of delusion."</i> (W57:19; H57:20) The Almighty says, <i>"To mankind the
love of worldly appetites is painted in glowing colours: women and children,
and heaped-up mounds of gold and silver, and horses with fine markings,
and livestock, and fertile farmland. All that is merely the enjoyment of
the life of this world. The best destination is in the presence of Allah,"
</i>(3:14) and the Almighty says,<i> "O mankind! Allah's promise is true.
Do not let the life of this world delude you and do not let the Deluder
delude you about Allah." </i>(35:5) The Almighty says<i>, "Fierce competition
for this world distracted you until you went down to the graves. No indeed,
you will soon know! Again no indeed, you will soon know! No indeed, if
you only knew with the Knowledge of Certainty." </i>(102:1-5) The Almighty
says, <i>"The life of this world is nothing but a game and a diversion.
The Abode of the Next World &shy; that is truly Life if they only knew."</i>
(W29:64; H29:63) The ayats concerning this subject are numerous and well-known.</blockquote>
457. 'Amr ibn 'Awf al-Ansari reported that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah to
Bahrayn to bring its jizya. He arrived with the money from Bahrayn and
the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubayda and appeared at the Fajr
prayer with the Messenger of Allah. When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had prayed, he went to leave and they presented
themselves before him. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, smiled when he saw them and said, 'I think you must have
heard that Abu 'Ubayda has arrived with something from Bahrayn?' They said,
'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Rejoice, and hope for what will gladden
you. By Allah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but I fear that this
world will be spread out in front of you as it was spread out in front
of those before you, and then you will vie for it as they vied for it,
and it will destroy you as it destroyed them.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>458. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "One day the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, sat on the minbar and we sat around him. He said,
'Part of what I fear for you after I have gone is the beauty and attraction
of this world which will be opened up to you.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>459. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "This world is sweet and green and
Allah Almighty has appointed you vice-regents in it, so pay attention to
what you do. Be fearful of this world and be fearful of women." [Muslim]
<p>460. Anas reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, said, "O Allah, there is no life but the life of the Next World."
[Agreed upon]
<p>461. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "Three things follow a dead person: his family,
his property and his actions. Two of them go back and one remains. His
family and property go back and his actions remain." [Agreed upon]
<p>462. Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "That one among the people of the Fire who was
wealthiest person in this world will be brought on the Day of the Fire,
dipped once into it and then asked, 'Son of Adam! Did anything good ever
happen to you? Did you ever experience any blessing?' He will say, 'By
Allah, no, my Lord.' That one among the people of the Garden who was the
most wretched person in this world will be brought and dipped once into
it and then asked, 'Son of Adam! Did you ever experience any misery ? Did
you ever undergo any hardship?' He will say, 'By Allah, no. I never experienced
any misery and I never underwent any hardship.'" [Muslim]
<p>463. Al-Mustawrid ibn Shaddad reported that the Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "This world in in comparison
with the Next World is like putting your finger in the sea and seeing what
comes back on it." [Muslim]
<p>464. Jabir reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, went through the market with people on both sides
of him. He passed the dead body of a deformed sheep, took it by its ear
and then said, "Which of you would like to have this for a dirham?" They
said, "We would not like to have it for anything. What would we do with
it?" He said, "Would you like to have it?" They said, "By Allah, even if
it was alive, it would be defective since it is deformed, and now it is
dead." He said, "By Allah, this world has less value with Allah than this
has with you." [Muslim]
<p>465. Abu Dharr said, "I was walking with the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, in the lava-bed at Madina and Uhud was looming
there in front of us. He said, 'Abu Dharr.' I said, 'At your service, Messenger
of Allah!' He said, 'It would not give me any pleasure if I had this Uhud
in gold and a dinar of it remained with me for more than three days except
for a dinar I would keep for paying debts. Rather I would say that it is
for so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so among the slaves of Allah,' indicating
to his right and to his left and behind him. Then he began to say, 'Those
who have a lot (in this world) will have little on the Day of Rising except
for someone who spends his money here and there and there, (to his right
and to his left and behind him) and they are few.' Then he said to me,
'Stay where you are until I come back.' Then he went off into the darkness
of the night until he disappeared. I heard a voice raised and I was afraid
that someone meant to harm the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace. I wanted to go, but then I remembered his words, 'Do not go until
I come back.' So I did not go until he came back to me and then I said,
'I heard a voice and was alarmed by it, but I remembered what you said.'
He said, 'Did you hear it?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'That was Jibril who
came to me
and said, "Anyone of your community who dies without associating
anything with Allah will enter the Garden."' I said, 'Even he if fornicates
and even if he steals?' He said, 'Even he if fornicates and even if he
steals.'" [Agreed upon]
<p>466. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "If I had the whole of Uhud in gold, it
would not make me happy for three days to pass while I have any of it except
something I have kept for a debt." [Agreed upon]
<p>467. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "Look at those who are lower than you and
do not look at those who are higher than you. That is more likely to prevent
you underestimating the blessing of Allah on you." [Agreed upon]
<p>These are the words of Muslim. In one variant, "When one of you sees
someone who has been given more bounty in respect of wealth or physical
strength, he should then look at someone who has less than him."
<p>468. Abu Hurayra reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "May the slave of the dinar and the dirham, the
<i>qatifa</i>
(outer garment) and <i>khamisa</i> (cloak) perish! If he is given them
he is pleased, and if he is not given them he is not pleased." [al-Bukhari]
<p>469. Abu Hurayra said, "I saw seventy of the people of the Suffa and
not a man among them had a cloak. They either had a waist wrapper or a
sheet (<i>kisa'</i>) which they tied round their necks, some reaching to
the middle of their legs and some reaching to the ankles. They would gather
them in their hands, not wanting their private parts to be seen." [al-Bukhari]
<p>470. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said, "This world is the prison of the believer
and the paradise of the unbeliever." [Muslim]
<p>471. Ibn 'Umar said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, took hold of my shoulders and said, 'Be in this world
as if you were a stranger or a traveller on the road.' Ibn 'Umar used to
say, 'In the evening, do not anticipate the morning, and in the morning
do not anticipate the evening. Take from your health for your illness and
from your life for your death."[al-Bukhari]
<p>They said in commentary on this hadith, that it means: do not rely on
this world and do not take it as your homeland and do not persuade yourself
that you are going to stay a long time in it nor be concerned with it nor
attached to it except with the attachment of a stranger who desires to
return to his people. Success is by Allah.
<p>472. Abu 'Abbas Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi said, "A man came to the Prophet,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah,
show me an action for which Allah will love me and for which people will
love me if I do it. He said, 'Do with little of this world and Allah will
love you, and do with little of what belongs to other people and people
will love you." [Ibn Majah]
<p>473. An-Nu'man ibn Bashir said, "'Umar ibn al-Khattab mentioned the
things of this world that the people had acquired and he said, 'One day
I saw the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
sifting through some bad dates he had found in order to fill his belly."
[Muslim]
<p>474. 'A'isha said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, died, there was nothing in my house that could be
eaten by a living creature except for half a barley loaf on a shelf. I
ate from it until I seemed to have had it for a long time. Then I measured
it and it finished." [Agreed upon]
<p>475. 'Amr ibn al-Harith, the brother of the Umm al-Mu'minin, Juwayriyya
bint al-Harith, said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, died, he left neither dirham nor dinar nor slave nor
slavegirl nor anything other than his white mule which he used to ride,
his weapons, and some land that he made sadaqa for travellers." [al-Bukhari]
<p>476. Khabbab ibn al-Aratt said, "We emigrated with the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, seeking the face of Allah
Almighty and our reward was in the hands of Allah. Some of us died without
consuming any of their reward, and Mus'ab ibn 'Umayr was one of them. He
was killed on the Day of Uhud and left a cloak. When we covered his head,
his feet showed, and when we covered his feet, his head showed. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, commanded us to cover
his head and to put some <i>idhkhir</i>-herb on his feet. Some of us have
picked the fruit of the reward and some of us are still gathering it."
[Agreed upom]
<p>477. Sahl ibn Sa'd as-Sa'idi reported that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If this world had been worth
as much as a gnat's wing in the eyes of Allah, no unbeliever would have
had a single drink of water from it." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>478. Abu Hurayra said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless

is in it, except for the remembrance of Allah Almighty and what brings
one near to Him and the teacher and the student." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>479. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported that the Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "Do not take possession of estates
or you will find yourselves seeking after this world." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>480. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As said, "The Messenger of Allah, may
Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed by us when we were working
on a hut we had. He said, 'What is this?' We said, 'It has become weak
and we are repairing it.' He said, 'I think that the matter is too urgent
for that.' [Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi]
<p>481. Ka'b ibn 'Iyad said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, say, 'Every community has a trial, and the
trial of my community is wealth.'" [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>482. Abu 'Amr (and it is said Abu 'Abdullah or Abu Layla) 'Uthman ibn
'Affan reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "The son of Adam only has a right to these three things: a house
in which to live, a garment with which to clothe his nakedness, and plain
bread and water." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>At-Tirmidhi said, "I heard Abu Dawud Sulayman ibn Salim al-Balkhi say,
'I heard an-Nadr ibn Shumayl say that <i>jilf</i> is bread which has no
condiment with it. Someone else said that it is coarse bread. Al-Harawi
said, "What is meant here is the bread basket, like <i>jawaliq</i> and
<i>khurj</i> (saddle-bags). And Allah knows best."
<p>483. 'Abdullah ibn ash-Shikhir said, "I came to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, when he was reciting <i>'Fierce competition
for this world distracted you.</i>'" (102:1) He said, 'The son of Adam
says, "My property! My property!" Son of Adam, have you any other property
than what you eat and thus gets used up, wear and thus becomes worn out,
and give in sadaqa and thus make effective?'" Muslim]
<p>484. 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal said, "A man said to the Prophet, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, 'Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I love you.'
He said, 'Be careful of what you say.' He said, 'By Allah, I love you,'
three times. He said, 'If you love me, then prepare yourself for poverty.
Poverty comes swifter to the one who loves me than a flood to its destination.'"
[at-Tirmidhi]
<p>485. Ka'b ibn Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, said, "Two hungry wolves loose among sheep
do not cause as much damage as that caused to a man's deen by his greed
for money and reputation." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>486. 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, slept on a straw mat and when he got up he had
a mark on his side. We said, 'Messenger of Allah, we could make a covering
for you?' He said, 'What have I to do with this world? I am only in this
world like a rider who seeks shade under a tree and then goes on.'" [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>487. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless

years before the rich." [at-Tirmidhi]
<p>488. Ibn 'Abbas and 'Imran ibn al-Husayn reported that the Prophet,

<p>489. Usama ibn Zayd reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, said, "I stood at the door of the Garden and most of those
who entered it were the very poor while the people of wealth were held
back. All the people of the Fire, however, were commanded to go straight
to the Fire." [Agreed upon]
<p>490. Abu Hurayra stated that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "The most truthful phrase ever said by a poet is the words
of Labid:
<p>'Everything except Allah is false.'" [Agreed upon]
