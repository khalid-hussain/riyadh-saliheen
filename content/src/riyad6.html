Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "One rider is shaytan.
Two riders are two shaytans. Three is a troop." [Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi,

962. Abu Hurayra reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "When you travel at a time of fertility, then
give the camel its share of the earth. When you travel at an arid time, then
travel quickly on it and hurry before its hump disappears. When you camp
at night, avoid the roadway. Roads are the paths of animals and the refuge
of reptiles at night." [Muslim]
<P>
963. Abu Qatada said, "When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, was on a journey, he would stop during the night, lying

would go off separately, going off into the ravines and valleys. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Your going off
separately into these ravines and valleys comes from Shaytan.' Then after
that they would always group together when they alighted in a place." [Abu
Dawud]
<P>
966. Sahl ibn 'Amr (and it is said Sahl ibn ar-Rabi' ibn 'Amr al-Ansari),
known as Ibn al-Hanzala, who was one of the people of the Pledge of Ridwan.
said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, passed

respect of these dumb animals. Ride them in good condition and eat them in
good condition." [Abu Dawud]
<P>
967. Abu Ja'far 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah
bless him and grant him peace, had me ride behind him one day and he confided
to me something which I will not relate to anyone else. The place which the
Messenger of Allah liked best for concealing himself when answering a call
of nature was a high barrier of some kind or a palm enclosure, i.e. a palm
garden." [Muslim]
<P>
Al-Barqani added to it after his words, "a palm enclosure," "He entered a
garden belonging to one of the Ansar. There was a camel there. When it saw
the Messenger of Allah, it made a noise and its eyes started watering. The
Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to it and stroked
its back - i.e. its hump and behind its ears - and then it calmed down. He
said, 'Who is the owner of this camel? To whom does this camel belong?' A
boy of the Ansar came and said, 'It is mine, Messenger of Allah.' He said,
'Do you not fear Allah regarding this animal over which Allah has given you
power? It complains to me that you starve it and tire it out." [Abu Dawud]
<P>
968. Anas said, "When we alighted in a place, we did not pray supererogatory
prayers until we had let the camels loose." [Abu Dawud]

969. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said, "While we were on a journey, a man came on
a mount of his and he began to look to the right and the left. The Messenger
of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'Anyone who has
a spare mount should offer it to someone who has not got one, and anyone
who has extra provisions should offer them to the someone who has no provisions.'
He went on mentioning various sorts of property until we thought that no
one had any right to anything extra." [Muslim]
<P>
970. Jabir reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and
grant him peace, wanted to go an expedition and said, "O company of Muhajirun
and Ansar! Among your brothers are people who have neither property nor tribe.

take turns in being carried like them." Jabir said, "I attached two or three
to myself and took turns on my camel like one of them." [Abu Dawud]
<P>
971. Jabir said, "The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
peace, used to go to the rear during journeys and he would urge on the weak

972. Ibn 'Umar reported that when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, settled on his camel to go out on a journey, he
said the takbir three times. Then he said, "Glory be to the One who has subjected
this to us when we did not have the ability to do it. We are turning to our
Lord. O Allah, we ask You in this journey of ours for piety and Godfearing
and action which is pleasing to You. O Allah, make this journey of ours easy
for us and roll up its distance for us. O Allah, You are our Companion in
the journey and our Khalif in our family. O Allah, I seek refuge with You
from the hardship of this journey and any sight which brings sorrow and an
inauspicious return in respect of property, family and children." When he
returned, he would say this and add to it, "Returning, turning in repentance,
worshipping our Lord, praising." [Muslim]

him and grant him peace, travelled, he sought refuge from the hardship of
the journey, from a sorrowful return, from decrease after substance, and
from the supplication of the wronged and from any evil sight in respect of
his family or property." [Muslim]
<P>
Scholars say that the meaning of <I>kawn</I> (substance) is to return from
a stable state or a state of increase to a state of decrease.
<P>
974. 'Ali ibn Rabi'a said, "I was once with 'Ali ibn Abi Talib when he was
brought an animal to ride. When he put his foot in the stirrup, he said,
'In the name of Allah,' When he was upright on its back, he said, 'Glory
be to Him who subjected this to us. We could never have done it by ourselves.
Indeed we are returning to our Lord!' Then he said, 'Praise be to Allah'
three times. Then he said, 'Allah is greater' three times. Then he said,
'Glory be to You. I have wronged myself, so forgive me. None forgives wrong
actions except You.' Then he laughed and was asked, 'Amir al-Mu'minin! what
made you laugh?' He said, 'I saw the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, do as I did. Then he laughed and I said, "O Messenger of Allah,
what made you laugh?" He said, "Your Lord marvels at His slave when he says,
'Forgive me my wrong actions, when he knows very well that no one other than
Me can forgive wrong actions.'" [Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi]

977. Ibn 'Umar reported that when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, returned from hajj or 'umra, whenever he went up a hill or a slope,

but Allah alone with no partner. To Him belongs the kingdom and to Him belongs
praise and He has power over everything, returning, turning in repentance,

Be kind to yourselves! You are not calling someone who is deaf or absent.
He is with you, listening.'" [Agreed upon]

'There is no god but Allah.' Whoever says that, his property and life are
protected from me, except when there is a legal right to them, and his reckoning
is up to Allah."?' Abu Bakr said, 'By Allah, I will fight anyone who makes
a distinction between prayer and <I>zakat</I>! <I>Zakat</I> is the right
which is due on wealth. By Allah, if they refuse me a nose-rope which they
used to pay to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him

side, forehead and back being branded with them. Every time they cool they
will be heated again throughout a day whose length is fifty thousand years,
until people's fates have been decided and he sees his way open either to
the Garden or to the Fire." It was said, "Messenger of Allah, what about
camels?" He said, "There is no owner of camels who fails to fulfil what is
due to them, and one of their rights is to be milked on the day they are
watered, without, on the Day of Rising, being thrown on his face on account
of them on a very wide level plain. Not one young camel will be missing and
they will trample him with their hooves and bite him with their teeth. When

to him throughout a day whose length is fifty thousand years until people's
fates have been decided and he sees his way open either to the Garden or

of them will have curved horns or no horns or broken horns. They will gore
him with their horns and trample him with their hooves. When the last of
them have passed over him, then the first of them will return to him in a
day whose length is fifty thousand years until people's fates have been decided
and he sees his way open either to the Garden or to the Fire."
<P>
It was asked, "Messenger of Allah, what about horses?" He said, "There are
three kinds of horses: those which are a burden for a man, those which are
a protection for a man and those which contain a reward for a man. Those
which are a burden for a man are those which are kept just for showing off,
boastfulness and out of enmity against the people of Islam. They are a burden.
Those which are a protection for a man are those a man keeps in the way of
Allah without forgetting Allah's right in respect of their backs and necks.
They are a protection for him. As for those which contain a reward for him,
they are those which a man keeps in meadows or grasslands in the way of Allah
for the people of Islam. For anything they eat of that meadow or grassland
there are good deeds written for him for what they ate and good deeds for
their droppings and urine. If one of them breaks its tether and goes over
a hillock or two, its tracks and droppings are also good deeds for him. If
it crosses a river and drinks from it when he had not intended to allow it
to drink from it, Allah writes for him the amount it drinks as good deeds
for him."
<P>
It was asked, "Messenger of Allah, what about donkeys?" He said, "Nothing

and grant him peace, said, "Allah, the Mighty and Exalted said, 'Every action
of the son of Adam is for himself except for fasting. It is Mine and I repay
it.' Fasting is a shield. When someone is fasting, he should not have sexual
relations nor quarrel. If someone fights him or insults him, he should say,
'I am fasting'. By the One in whose hand the self of Muhammad is, the changed
breath in the mouth of the faster is more fragrant to Allah than the scent
of musk. The faster experiences two joys: when he breaks his fast he rejoices
and when he meets his Lord he rejoices in his fasting." [Agreed upon]

In one variant of al-Bukhari, "He has left his food and drink and appetites
for My sake. Fasting is Mine and I repay it. Any other good deed I repay
with ten like it."

be called from the gate of the prayer. All the people who did jihad will
be called from the gate of jihad. All the people who fasted will be called
from the gate of Rayyan. All the people who gave sadaqa will be called from
the gate of sadaqa." Abu Bakr said, "May my father and mother be sacrificed
for you, Messenger of Allah. No one called from those gates will feel distress.
Will anyone be called from all those gates?" He said, "Yes, and I hope that
you will be among them." [Agreed upon]
