noble character, talking with a guest, talking with someone who has a need

for talk which is due to an excuse or event: it is not disliked. Sound hadiths

<P>
These hadiths forbid it while there are many sound hadiths which permit it.
Scholars say that the mention of combining the hadiths is to say that if
the person praised has complete faith and certainty, self discipline and
full knowledge, then he is not tempted or deluded by that. His self will
not play with him and so it is neither forbidden or disliked. If any of these
matters is feared for him, then it is strongly disliked to praise him to
his face. It is on the basis of this distinction that the hadiths about that
vary. Among those which allow praise is what the Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to Abu Bakr, "I hope that you will be one of
them," i.e. one of those who will be invited to enter by all the gates of
the Garden." In another hadith, "You are not one of them," i.e, those who
drag their waist-wrappers out of arrogance." The Prophet, may Allah bless
him and grant him peace, said to 'Umar, "Shaytan does not see you travelling
down one pass but that he travels by a different pass." There are many hadiths
which allow it, some of which can be found in Kitab al-Adhkar.

1791. Ibn 'Abbas reported that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab set out for Syria and
reached as far as Sargh where the commanders of the armies, Abu 'Ubayda ibn

broken out in Syria. Ibn 'Abbas said, "'Umar said to me, 'Call the early
Muhajirun for me,' and so I called them and he consulted them and informed
them that the plague had broken out in Syria. They disagreed. Some of them
said, 'You have set out on a matter and we do not think that you should retreat
from it.' Others said, 'With you are the rest of the people and the Companions
of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and we
do not think that you should expose them to this plague.' He said, 'Leave
me.' Then he said, 'Call the Ansar for me,' and I called them and he consulted
them. They behaved as the Muhajirun had done and disagreed as they had disagreed.
He said, 'Leave me.' Then he said, 'Call for me those who are here of the
elders of Quraysh who emigrated before the Conquest of Makka.' So I called
them, and there were not two of them who disagreed about it. They said, 'We
think that you should return with the people and not expose them to this
plague.' So 'Umar made an announcement among the people: 'I am travelling
back in the morning, so travel back then as well.' Abu 'Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah
said, 'Are you fleeing from the decree of Allah?' 'Umar said, 'If only someone
other than you had said that, Abu 'Ubayda!' 'Umar did not like his opposition.
'Yes, we are fleeing from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. Do
you think that if you had camels and they went down into a valley which had
two sides, one of which was fertile and the other barren, and you grazed
them on the fertile side, that that grazing would be by the decree of Allah,
and if you grazed them on the barren side, that that grazing would not be
by the decree of Allah?'" He said, "Then 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn 'Awf, who had
been absent on some errand, came up and said, 'I have some knowledge of this.
I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
say, "When you hear that it is in a place, do not go forward to it. If it

in the morning you mentioned the Dajjal and then lowered your voice about

"He said, 'It is not the Dajjal which alarms me with regard to you. If he
were to emerge while I was still among you, I would overcome him with arguments
for you. If he emerges when I am not among you, then a man must have his
own arguments and I leave Allah watching over every Muslim. He is a youth
with curly hair who is blind in one eye. I could liken him to 'Abdu'l-'Uzza

pearls will flow down. It is not lawful for any unbeliever to experience

He will hunt the Dajjal until he catches him at the gate of Ludd where he

from the Dajjal, and he will wipe their faces and speak to them of their
degrees in the Garden. While that is happening, Allah Almighty will reveal
to 'Isa, "I have brought forth some slaves of Mine whom no one will be capable

The Prophet of Allah, 'Isa, and his Companions, may Allah be pleased them,

necks and they will carry them away and put them down wherever Allah wishes.
Then Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, will send down rain which no house of
mud or hair can withstand and it will wash the earth until it is left like
a mirror. Then he will say to the earth, "Produce your fruits and display
your blessing." On that day a whole group will be satisfied by eating one
pomegranate and its rind will be big enough to shade them all. Milk will

no one who has an atom's weight of good or belief in his heart will be left

to go inside a mountain, it would get into where he was to seize him. The

Shaytan will take on a form for them and will say, 'Will you obey?" And they
will say, 'What is your command?' He will command them to worship idols.
They will have plentiful provision there and a good livelihood. Then the
Trumpet will be blown. No one will hear it without inclining his neck towards
the sound to listen. The first to hear it will be a man plastering his camels'
watering-trough, and he will swoon and everyone will swoon. Then Allah will

am going to visit this one who has emerged.' They will say, 'And do you not
believe in our lord?' He will say, 'Our Lord is not hidden.' They will say,
'Kill him!' Then they will say to one another, 'Did your lord not forbid
you to kill anyone without his permission?' They will take him to the Dajjal.
When the believer sees him, he will say, "O people! This is the Dajjal whom
the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, referred
to!' The Dajjal will command him to be stretched out and will say, 'Take
him and beat him on the face.' His back and chest will be made wider by beating.
He will say, 'Do you not believe in me?' He will say, 'You are the false
Messiah!' He will command him to be sawn with a saw from the middle of his
head until he is split down to his feet.' Then the Dajjal will walk between
the two halves and say to him, 'Get up,' and he will stand up straight. Then
he will say to him, 'Do you believe in me?' He will say, "I have only been
increased in insight into you.' Then he will say. "O people! I am the last
person he will act like this towards.' The Dajjal will seize him to slaughter
him, but Allah will turn his entire neck into brass and he will be unable
to do it. He will take hold of his hands and feet and throw him, and people
will imagine that he has thrown him into the Fire, but he will have thrown
him into the Garden.'" The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant

sold you the land and what it contains.' So they took the argument to a man
and the one to whom they took it said, 'Do either of you have a child?' One

traveller, a man who sells goods to a man after <I>'Asr</I> and swears by
Allah that he bought them for such-and-such, and the man believes him, when
that is not the case, and a man who offers allegiance to an Imam and only

Hour." [al-Bukhari]

to death. He said, 'It does not mean that, but the when the believer is given
the good news of the mercy of Allah and His pleasure and His garden, he wants
to meet Allah. and so Allah wants to meet him. When the unbeliever is given
the news of the punishment of Allah and His wrath, he is averse to meeting

close to the Messenger of Allah and did not leave him. The Messenger of Allah,
may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was on a white mule of his. When
the Muslims and the idolaters met, the Muslims turned in retreat. The Messenger
of Allah began to press his mule towards the unbelievers while I was holding
the bridle of the mule of the Messenger of Allah restraining it, not wanting
it to rush forward. Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of the Messenger of
Allah. The Messenger of Allah said, 'O 'Abbas! Call the people of the Acacia
Tree!'" Al-'Abbas, who was a man with a loud voice, said, "I shouted in my
loudest voice, 'Where are the people of the Acacia Tree!' By Allah, it was
as if it turned them round when they heard my voice as cows turn to their
calves. They said, 'At your service! At your service!' So they fought the
unbelievers. The call among the Ansar was that they said, 'O company of the
Ansar! O company of the Ansar!' Then the call was shortened to the Banu'-Harith
ibn al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah looked, while he was on his mule,
as if he were craning his neck towards the battle. He said, 'This is when
the oven is hot.' Then the Messenger of Allah took some pebbles and threw
them in the faces of the unbelievers and then said, 'They are defeated, by
the Lord of Muhammad!' I went to look and there was the battle going on and,
by Allah, as soon as he threw the pebbles at them, I saw their force weakened
and they retreated.'" [Muslim]
<P>

rightly,'</I> (23:52) and the Almighty said, <I>'O you who believe, eat of
the good things that We have provided for you.' </I>(W2:171; H2:172) Then
he mentioned a man who goes on a long journey, is dishevelled and dusty and
stretches his hands to heaven saying , 'O Lord! O Lord!' when his food is

ibn az-Zubayr said about a certain sale or gift which 'A'isha had made, "By
Allah, if 'A'isha does not stop I will declare her legally incompetent!"
She said, "Did he really say that?" They said, "Yes." She said, "By Allah,
I vow that I will never speak to Ibn az-Zubayr again!" When the disassociation
had gone on for a long time, Ibn az-Zubayr had someone intercede on his behalf,
but she said, "No, by Allah, I will not accept intercession on his behalf
ever and I will not break my vow!" When that had gone on too long for Ibn
az-Zubayr, he spoke to al-Miswar ibn Makhrama and 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-Aswad
ibn 'Abd Yaghuth and said to them, "I ask you by Allah to take me to 'A'isha
for it is not lawful for her to vow to cut me off." Al-Miswar and 'Abdu'r-Rahman
went with him and the two of them asked permission to visit 'A'isha. They
said, "Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings! May we
enter?" 'A'isha said, "Enter." They said, "All of us?" She said, "Yes, all
of you enter," not knowing that Ibn az-Zubayr was with them. When they entered,
Ibn az-Zubayr went behind the curtain and embraced 'A'isha and began to implore
her and weep. Al-Miswar and 'Abdu'r-Rahman began to implore her to speak
to him and accept his apology. They said, "The Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, forbade disassociation as you very well know, and said
that it is not lawful for a Muslim to disassociate himself from his brother
for more than three days." When they kept on reminding and forbidding 'A'isha
for a long time, she began to remind them and weep. She said, "I made a vow,
and the vow is a serious thing." They kept at her until she spoke to Ibn
az-Zubayr. To expiate that vow, she set free forty slaves. After that, whenever
she remembered her oath, she would weep until her tears made her scarf wet.

and the dead. Then he stepped up onto the minbar and said, "I am going ahead
of you and I am a witness over you. Your meeting-place with me is the Basin.
I am looking at it from where I am. I do not fear for you that you will associate
others with Allah. I fear this world for you and that you will vie with each
other for it." He said, "It was the last time I looked at the Messenger of
Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace." [Agreeed upon]

I am looking now at my Basin and I have been given the keys of the treasures
of the earth - or the keys of the earth. By Allah, I do not fear that you
will associate others with Allah after me, but I fear that you will vie with
each other in respect of it."

them, not the prayer itself.

and prayed and then he ascended the minbar until it was time of <I>'Asr</I>.

third blow, has such-and-such a good deed."

I will again give sadaqa.' He went out with his sadaqa and this time put
it in the hand of an adulteress. The next day people said that he had given
sadaqa in the night to an adulteress. He said, 'O Allah, praise is Yours.
I gave it to an adulteress. I will give more sadaqa.' He went out with his
sadaqa and put it in the hand of a rich man. The next day people said he
had given sadaqa to a rich man. He said, 'O Allah, praise is Yours. I have
given sadaqa to a thief, an adulteress, and a rich man.' Then someone said
to him, 'Your sadaqa to a thief might make him abstain from stealing. What
you gave to the adulteress might make her abstain from her fornication. And
what you gave to the rich man might make him reflect so that he will spend
out from what Allah has given him.'" [al-Bukhari]

which he liked, and ate some of it. He said, 'I will be the master of people
on the Day of Rising. Do you know what that will entail? Allah will gather
the first and the last on the same plain so that an observer will be able
to see them and a speaker make them hear. The sun will be brought near to
them and people will experience such sorrow and distress that they will not
be able to bear or endure it. They will say, 'Do you not see what a state
you are in and what has come to you? Why do you not look for someone to intercede
with your Lord on your behalf?' People will say to one another, 'Your father
Adam!' They will come to him and say, 'O Adam! You are the father of mankind.
Allah created you with His hand and breathed some of His spirit into you
and He ordered the angels to prostrate to you. He made you dwell in the Garden.
Will you not intercede with your Lord on our behalf? Do you not see what
we are suffering and what has happened to us?' He will say, 'My Lord is angry
today with such anger as has never existed before nor will again. He forbade
me the Tree and I disobeyed. O my soul! My soul! My soul! Go to someone else.
Go to Nuh.'

"They will go to Nuh and say, 'O Nuh! You are the first of the Messengers

Do you not see what we are suffering and what has happened to us?' Will you
not intercede with your Lord on our behalf?' He will say, 'My Lord is angry

'My Lord is angry today with such anger as has never existed before nor will
again. I told three lies. O my soul! My soul! My soul! Go to someone else.
Go to Musa.'
<P>
"They will go to Musa and say, 'O Musa, you are the Messenger of Allah. Allah
preferred you with His message and His Word above all other people. Intercede
with your Lord for us. Do you not see what we are suffering?' He will say,
'My Lord is angry today with such anger as has never existed before nor will
again. I killed a soul which I was not commanded to kill. Go to someone else.
Go to 'Isa.'
<P>
"They will go to 'Isa and say, 'O 'Isa! You are the Messenger of Allah and
His Word which He cast to Maryam and a spirit from Him. You spoke to people
while in the cradle. Intercede with your Lord on our behalf. Do you not see
what we are suffering?' 'Isa will say, 'My Lord is angry today with such
anger as has never existed before nor will again,' and he did not mention
a sin. 'O my soul! My soul! My soul! Go to someone else. Go to Muhammad.'"
<P>
In one variant, "They will come to me and say, 'O Muhammad! You are the Messenger
of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. Allah has forgiven you your past and
future wrong actions. Intercede with your Lord on our behalf. Do you not
see what we are suffering?' I will go and arrive under the Throne and fall
down in prostration to my Lord. Then Allah will inspire me with some words
to praise and laud Him with which He will have inspired no one before me.
Then it will be said, 'O Muhammad, raise your head. Ask and your request
will be granted. Intercede and your intercession will be accepted. Lift your
head!' I will lift my head and say, 'O my Lord, my community! O my Lord,
my community!' It will be said, 'O Muhammad, bring in by the right-hand gate
of the gates of the Garden those of your community who will not be subjected
to any reckoning, and the rest of your community can share the other gates
with other people.'" Then he said, "By the One in whose hand my soul is,
the distance between the two gateposts of the gates of the Garden is as far
as between Makka and Hajar or Makka and Busra." [Agreed upon]

1867. Ibn 'Abbas said, "Ibrahim brought the mother of Isma'il and her son,
Isma'il, whom she was nursing and put her near the House by a tall tree above
Zamzam in the upper part of the mosque. At that time no one lived in Makka
and there was no water there. He put them there and left with her a bag with
some dates in it and a waterskin with some water in it. Then Ibrahim returned
the way he had come. Isma'il's mother followed him and said, 'O Ibrahim!
Where are you going, leaving us in this valley in which there are no people
or anything else?' She said that to him several times but he did not turn
to her. She said to him, 'Has Allah commanded you to do this?' He said, 'Yes.'
She said, 'Then He will not let us come to harm,' and went back. Ibrahim
went on until he reached ath-Thaniyya where they could not see him. He turned
to face the House and then made a supplication with these words..He raised
his hands and said, <I>'Our Lord! I settled some of my offspring by Your
Sacred House in an uncultivated valley </I>.to .<I>.so that hopefully they
will be thankful.' </I>(W14:39; H14:37) Isma'il's mother began to suckle
him and drink from the water until the water in the skin had run out. She
was thirsty and her son was thirsty. She looked at him twisting about" -
or he said, "rolling on the ground" - "and then walked away, not wanting
to look at him. Safa was the nearest hill to her and she climbed up it and
then looked around the valley to see if there was anyone there. She could
not see anyone and descended from Safa until she reached the valley. Then
she lifted the edge of her skirt and ran as an overwrought person runs until
she had crossed the valley. Then she came to Marwa and stood on it and looked
to see whether there was anyone there. She could not see anyone. She did
that seven times." Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him
and grant him peace, said, "That is why people run between them." "Then,
on Marwa, when she looked she heard a voice and said, 'Listen!' trying to
hear. Then she listened and heard and said, 'I have heard if You possess
any relief.' Suddenly there was an angel at the site of Zamzam. He struck
the ground with his heel - or his wing - until water appeared. She made a
container with her hands, like this, and began to scoop up the water into
her waterskin and it bubbled up each time she scooped."
<P>
In one variant, "According to the amount she scooped up."
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said, "May Allah have mercy on the mother of Isma'il. If she had
left Zamzam" - or he said, "If she had not scooped up the water" - "Zamzam
would have begun as a running stream." He said, "She drank and suckled her
son and the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid of perishing. This boy and
his father will build a house here for Allah. Allah will not let its people
perish. The house was higher than the land around it, like on a hill to which
floods come and then go to the right and left of it. She remained like that
until a group of the Jurhum, or people from a clan of Jurhum, coming by way
of Kada' alighted at the bottom of Makka and saw birds circling round and
said, 'These birds are circling around water. We are familiar with this valley
and there is no water in it.' They sent one or two scouts and when they found
the water, they returned and told them. They advanced and found Isma'il's
mother at the water. They said, 'Will you give us permission to alight here
with you?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to the water.' They said,
'Yes.'"
<P>
Ibn 'Abbas said that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
said, "This happened to Isma'il's mother because she desired human companionship.
They alighted and sent for their families and settled there with them so
that they became people with houses. The boy grew up and learned Arabic from
them. As a youth, he was the dearest and most admired of them. When he came
of age, he married a woman from among them. Isma'il's mother died and Ibrahim
came after Isma'il had married to look for something he had left behind.
He did not find Isma'il at home. He asked his wife about him and she said,
'He has gone out to look for food for us.' (One variant had, 'to hunt for
us.') Then he asked about their life and circumstances. She said, 'We are
in a very bad way. We are suffering constriction and hardship,' and she
complained to him. He said, 'When your husband comes, greet him from me and
tell him to change his door lintel.' When Isma'il came, it was as if he sensed
something and he said, 'Did someone come?' She said, 'Yes, such-and-such
an old man came and he asked about you and I told him. He asked me about
our life and I told him that we were suffering difficulty and hardship.'
He said, 'Did he give you any advice?' She said, 'Yes. He told me to give
you greetings and to say: "Change the lintel of your door."' He said, 'That
was my father and he has commanded that I separate from you. Go back to your
family.' So he divorced her and married another woman. Ibrahim remained away
from them as long as Allah wished and then he visited them again and did
not find him at home. He visited his wife and asked about him and she said,
'He has gone out looking for food for us.' He said, 'How are you?' and he
asked her about their life and circumstances. She said, 'We are well,' and
she praised Allah Almighty. He said, 'What is your food?' She said, 'Meat.'
He said, 'What is your drink?' She said, 'Water.' He said, 'O Allah, bless
them in their meat and water.'" The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant
him peace, said, "At that time they did not have grain. If they had had it,
he would have prayed for them in respect of it as well." He said, "This is
why no one except the people of Makka can manage with these two alone when
they do not agree with other people.'"
<P>
In one variant, "He came and said, 'Where is Isma'il?' His wife said, 'He
has gone hunting.' His wife said, 'Will you not alight and eat and drink?'
He said, 'What is your food and what is your drink?' She said, 'Our food
is meat and our drink is water.' He said, 'O Allah, bless them in their food
and drink.'" He said that Abu'l-Qasim said, "The blessing of the supplication
of Ibrahim." 
<P>
"He said, 'When your husband comes, give him the greeting and tell him to
strengthen the lintel of his door.' When Isma'il came, he said, 'Did someone
come to you?' She said, 'Yes, an old man of handsome appearance came to us,'
and she praised him. 'He asked me about you and I told him and he asked me
how our life was and I told him that we were well.' He said, 'Did he give
you any advice?' She said, 'Yes, he gave you the greeting and told you to
strengthen the lintel of your door.' He said, 'That was my father. You are
the lintel. He told me to keep you.' Then he remained away from them for
as long as Allah wished. Then he came after that one day while Isma'il was
sharpening his arrows under a large tree near Zamzam. When he saw him, he
went to him and did as a father does with a son and a son with a father.
He said, 'Isma'il, Allah has given me a command.' He said, 'Do what Allah
has commanded you.' He said, 'Will you help me.'.He said, 'I will help you.'
He said, 'Allah has commanded me to build a house here,' and he pointed at
a mound which was higher than the surrounding land. In that place he laid
the foundations of the House. Isma'il began to bring stones and Ibrahim laid
them until the structure reached a certain height. Then he brought a stone
and placed it for him and he stood on it, building, while Isma'il passed
up the stones to him. They were saying,<I> 'Our Lord, accept this from us!
You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.'</I>" (W2:126; H2:127)
<P>
In one variant, "Ibrahim went out with Isma'il and Isma'il's mother with
a waterskin, containing some water. Isma'il's mother began to drink from
the waterskin and suckled her child until he reached Makka where he placed
her under a large tree. Then Ibrahim left to return to his family. Isma'il's
mother followed him until they reached Kada', when she called out behind
him, 'O Ibrahim! With whom are you leaving us?' He said, 'With Allah.' She
said, 'I am satisfied with Allah,' and she went back and began to drink from
the waterskin and nurse her child until the water was finished. She said,
'If I go and look perhaps I will find someone.'" He said, "She went and climbed
Safa and looked and looked to see whether she could find someone, but she
did not see anyone. When she reached the valley, she ran and came to Marwa.
She did that several times. Then she said, 'I should go and see what is happening
with the child.' She went and looked and there he was in the same condition
as if he was gasping at the brink of death. She could not contain herself
and said, 'If I go and look perhaps I will find someone.' She went and climbed
Safa and looked and looked but did not see anyone, until she had done that
seven times. Then she had just said, 'I should go and look and see what is
happening with him,' when she heard a voice. She said, 'Help me, if You possess
any good!' Then Jibril appeared and dug his heel into the earth and water
began to spring up. Isma'il's mother was astonished and began to dig," and
he recounted the hadith in full. [al-Bukhari]

had Allah not guided us." (7:42) O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of
Muhammad as You blessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Grant blessing
to Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You granted blessing to Ibrahim
and the family of Ibrahim. You are Praiseworthy, Glorious.
